      <description>Study materials: Reading material: DOWNLOAD Homework assignment: No homework assignment.&#xA;Lecture summary: The lecture on prosocial behavior begins by defining it as any act intended to benefit another person. Altruism is described as helping others even at a cost to oneself. Evolutionary psychology suggests that prosocial behavior, especially towards genetic relatives, is favored by natural selection. The norm of reciprocity indicates that helping others increases the likelihood of future help. Social exchange theory posits that people help when the benefits outweigh the costs, suggesting true altruism may not exist.</description>
