      <title>LECTURE 11: Prosocial Behavior</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-12/week-12-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explores the foundations and determinants of prosocial behavior, beginning with a historical example of extreme altruism during the Chernobyl disaster, where volunteers risked their lives to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. Empirical research shows even young children display early signs of empathic concern and prosocial behavior, which increases with age. Prosocial behavior is defined as any act intended to benefit another, with altruism representing actions undertaken solely for others&amp;rsquo; welfare, often at personal cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 10: Aggression</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-11/week-11-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aggression represents intentional behavior aimed at causing physical or psychological harm, with violence as its most extreme form. The distinction between hostile aggression, driven by anger and intent to inflict pain, and instrumental aggression, used as a means to achieve other goals, underpins research in this domain. Evolutionary perspectives argue that men are predisposed to physical aggression to establish dominance and ensure reproductive success, whereas female aggression is often linked to offspring protection. Animal studies illustrate the interplay between innate tendencies and environmental influences, with evidence showing that social experiences can override aggressive instincts, though some forms of aggression remain biologically hardwired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 9: Prejudice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-10/week-10-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prejudice is defined as a hostile or negative attitude towards individuals based solely on their group membership, encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioral elements. Cognitively, the mind&amp;rsquo;s natural tendency to categorize can lay the groundwork for prejudice. This often involves stereotypes: generalizations assigning traits to all members of a group, a mental shortcut described by Gordon Allport as &amp;ldquo;the law of least effort,&amp;rdquo; which can bias perception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The affective, or emotional, component makes prejudice resistant to logical arguments. Behaviorally, prejudice can manifest as discrimination—unjustified negative actions. While linked, not all prejudiced attitudes translate into discriminatory behavior due to social norms or personal values. Uncovering hidden prejudices is complex; methods like the Implicit Association Test (IAT) aim to reveal subconscious biases, though its direct link to overt actions remains debated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 8: Conformity and Obedience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-9/week-9-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on conformity and obedience in social psychology outlined various forms of social influence: persuasion, compliance, conformity, and obedience. Persuasion involves actively changing attitudes through communication, while compliance refers to behavior change triggered by requests, without necessarily altering beliefs. Conformity is an adjustment of behavior or attitudes to align with group norms, often driven by the desire for social acceptance, whereas obedience involves following direct commands from authority figures, focusing mainly on external behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Groups are defined as two or more individuals who interact and influence each other, often driven by shared goals and interdependence. People join groups for evolutionary advantages, goal achievement, identity formation, and adherence to social norms. Groups typically consist of three to six members and are shaped by social norms and roles, which guide behavior but can also lead to identity loss when roles are overly internalized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group cohesiveness fosters member retention and participation but may hinder performance if harmony is prioritized over effective solutions. While similarity enhances cohesiveness, diversity—across race, experience, and attitudes—can improve group performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 6: Persuasion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-6/week-6-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on persuasion explored various facets of persuasive communication and its impact on attitude change. Persuasion involves messages aimed at altering attitudes and behaviors, with key elements including the communicator, the message, the medium, and audience characteristics. The lecture highlighted the third-person effect, where individuals believe they are less influenced by advertisements than others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attitude change often results from social influence and persuasive communication, with emotional and cognitive appeals playing significant roles. Fear appeals are effective when paired with solutions, while advertising leverages affective and cognitive appeals based on cultural contexts. The lecture also discussed self-generated persuasion, where individuals change attitudes by generating their own arguments, and cognitive dissonance, which occurs when actions contradict beliefs, prompting attitude alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Attitudes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-5/week-5-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on attitudes in social psychology explored the origins, components, and influences on attitudes. Attitudes are evaluations of people, objects, and ideas, shaped by genetics and social experiences. They consist of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Cognitively based attitudes rely on beliefs about an object, while affectively based attitudes stem from feelings and values, often influenced by conditioning. Behaviorally based attitudes are derived from observing one&amp;rsquo;s behavior toward an object, as explained by self-perception theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Social Cognition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-4/week-4-sp-man-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on social cognition explored how individuals perceive and interpret the social world. It highlighted the distinction between automatic and controlled thinking. Automatic thinking is non-conscious, effortless, and involves the use of schemas—mental structures that help organize social information. These schemas are influenced by culture and can be primed by recent experiences, affecting judgments and decisions. The lecture also discussed the self-fulfilling prophecy, where expectations about others can influence their behavior, making those expectations come true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: The Self</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-3/week-3-sp-man-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 17:52:39 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-man-prmc/week-3/week-3-sp-man-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explored the concept of self, focusing on self-concept, self-awareness, and self-perception. Self-concept is defined as the beliefs individuals hold about their personal attributes, with self-schema acting as a cognitive framework guiding perception and evaluation. The development of self-concept begins in early childhood, with human self-recognition emerging between 18-24 months. Cultural influences shape self-concept, with independent and interdependent views of self highlighting differences in self-definition based on personal attributes versus relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on social psychology explored various questions about human behavior and social interactions, such as how people perceive and reason about the social world, the dynamics of group membership, factors influencing aggression and prejudice, and the reasons behind interpersonal attraction and cooperation. It also examined the effectiveness of political advertisements and the motivations for helping behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address these questions, the lecture emphasized the importance of the scientific method, which involves generating hypotheses, testing them, and communicating findings. It distinguished between science, pseudoscience, protoscience, and nonscience, highlighting the need for falsifiability in scientific hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture treated the profound effects of social influence and isolation on human behavior and cognition. It highlighted a study involving nine polar expeditioners in Antarctica, revealing significant reductions in the volume of the dentate gyrus due to social isolation, underscoring the brain&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability to such conditions. The lecture also examined the tragic events of the Jonestown massacre, illustrating the extreme power of social influence under cult leader Jim Jones, where 914 individuals perished after being coerced into a mass suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
