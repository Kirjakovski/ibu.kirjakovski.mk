      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A group is defined as two or more individuals who interact and influence each other, often forming around shared goals, needs, or identities. Evolutionarily, groups enhanced survival by facilitating cooperation in tasks like hunting and caregiving. They also provide social norms and roles that guide behavior, though these can sometimes suppress individuality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Groups typically consist of three to six members and are shaped by norms, roles, cohesiveness, and diversity. While cohesiveness strengthens bonds, it can hinder performance if harmony is prioritized over effective decision-making. Diversity, especially in race and experience, can enhance group outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 6: Persuasion</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on persuasion explored various facets of persuasive communication and its impact on attitude change. Persuasion involves messages aimed at altering attitudes and behaviors, with key elements including the communicator, the message, the medium, and audience characteristics. The lecture highlighted the third-person effect, where individuals believe they are less influenced by advertisements than others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attitude change often results from social influence and persuasive communication, with emotional and cognitive appeals playing significant roles. Fear appeals are effective when paired with solutions, while advertising leverages affective and cognitive appeals based on cultural contexts. The lecture also discussed self-generated persuasion, where individuals change attitudes by generating their own arguments, and cognitive dissonance, which occurs when actions contradict beliefs, prompting attitude alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Attitudes</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attitudes are evaluations of people, objects, and ideas, shaped by genetics and social experiences. They have three components: cognitive (based on beliefs), affective (rooted in emotions and values), and behavioral (inferred from actions). Attitudes can be explicit (consciously endorsed) or implicit (unconscious and shaped by early experiences).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their influence on behavior depends on accessibility and context. Spontaneous actions align with strong, readily available attitudes, while deliberate behavior follows the Theory of Planned Behavior, which considers specific attitudes, social norms, and perceived control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Social Cognition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-pcg-psy/week-4/week-4-sp-psy-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on social cognition explored how individuals perceive and interpret the social world. It highlighted the distinction between automatic and controlled thinking. Automatic thinking is non-conscious, effortless, and involves the use of schemasâ€”mental structures that help organize social information. These schemas are influenced by culture and can be primed by recent experiences, affecting judgments and decisions. The lecture also discussed the self-fulfilling prophecy, where expectations about others can influence their behavior, making those expectations come true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: The Self</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-pcg-psy/week-3/week-3-sp-psy-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explored the concept of self, focusing on self-concept, self-awareness, and self-perception. Self-concept is defined as the beliefs individuals hold about their personal attributes, with self-schema acting as a cognitive framework guiding perception and evaluation. The development of self-concept begins in early childhood, with human self-recognition emerging between 18-24 months. Cultural influences shape self-concept, with independent and interdependent views of self highlighting differences in self-definition based on personal attributes versus relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 2: Methodology to Social Psychology</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-psychology-pcg-psy/week-2/week-2-sp-psy-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on social psychology explored various questions about human behavior and social interactions, such as how people perceive and reason about the social world, the dynamics of group membership, factors influencing aggression and prejudice, and the reasons behind interpersonal attraction and cooperation. It also examined the effectiveness of political advertisements and the motivations for helping behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address these questions, the lecture emphasized the importance of the scientific method, which involves generating hypotheses, testing them, and communicating findings. It distinguished between science, pseudoscience, protoscience, and nonscience, highlighting the need for falsifiability in scientific hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture treated the profound effects of social influence and isolation on human behavior and cognition. It highlighted a study involving nine polar expeditioners in Antarctica, revealing significant reductions in the volume of the dentate gyrus due to social isolation, underscoring the brain&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability to such conditions. The lecture also examined the tragic events of the Jonestown massacre, illustrating the extreme power of social influence under cult leader Jim Jones, where 914 individuals perished after being coerced into a mass suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
