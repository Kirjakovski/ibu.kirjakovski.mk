      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the development of machines capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human and animal intelligence, such as reasoning, perception, planning, and motor control. AI applications span diverse fields, from daily life (smart homes, autonomous cars) to specialized domains like finance, healthcare, robotics, and creative arts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It outlined key types of AI, including symbolic AI, artificial neural networks, evolutionary programming, cellular automata, and dynamical systems. Symbolic AI focuses on logic-based problem solving, while neural networks mimic brain functions for pattern recognition. Evolutionary programming imitates biological evolution, cellular automata explore simple rule-based models, and dynamical systems study time-dependent changes. The historical context highlighted Ada Lovelace&amp;rsquo;s foundational ideas, Alan Turing’s universal machine and Turing Test, and McCulloch-Pitts’ neuron-based computation models. Early milestones showcased AI’s ability to solve logical problems, learn from data, and mimic neural patterns, with cybernetics emphasizing feedback loops and adaptive systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explored the biological and genetic factors influencing intelligence, focusing on the brain&amp;rsquo;s role in cognitive abilities. Larger brain sizes, both across species and within humans, correlate with higher intelligence. Modern neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI, have established robust connections between brain size and IQ, emphasizing the significance of gray and white matter in problem-solving and information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is not localized to a single brain region but arises from distributed functions across areas like the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) identifies key processes, such as sensory integration, abstraction, and response evaluation, involving specific regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. Efficient connectivity among these areas enhances cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Development of Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-5/haai-post-lecture-5/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explored intelligence development, highlighting factors shaping human intelligence. In infancy, intelligence manifests through early learning, such as visual preferences, sound recognition, and novelty response. Research methods in infant intelligence, including observation and brain imaging, help understand cognitive progress and sensitivity to environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of sensitive periods was discussed, emphasizing key phases when environmental inputs, like social interactions or sensory experiences, significantly shape cognitive abilities. Physical aspects such as prenatal health, nutrition, and exposure to pollutants were outlined for their impact on brain development and cognitive functions. Social influences on intelligence, including socioeconomic status and parental education, further underscore environmental impact. Early childhood programs and quality education improve cognitive abilities and lay foundations for future learning. Overall, intelligence emerges through a dynamic interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with both early interventions and sustained educational opportunities playing essential roles in fostering cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Kinds of Human Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-4/haai-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture focused on alternative models of intelligence beyond the traditional “g-factor.” This general intelligence factor, suggested by Charles Spearman, proposes that cognitive abilities correlate with one another, indicating a common underlying intelligence. However, theories like Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences argue for distinct, independent intelligences such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, and spatial, though critics challenge its lack of empirical support and practical application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emotional Intelligence (EI), popularized by Salovey, Mayer, and later Goleman, involves the capacity to perceive, use, and regulate emotions. EI is linked to various life domains, from social relationships to health. Tests like the MSCEIT assess EI based on the four-branch model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: Theoretical Frameworks of Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-3/haai-post-lecture-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence theories provide frameworks for understanding cognitive abilities across different dimensions. Scientific theories are supported by empirical evidence, are falsifiable, and have predictive power. Proximal explanations address immediate causes, while distal ones offer long-term reasoning. Psychometric theories of intelligence summarize cognitive performance variations using a small number of dimensions, such as reasoning, verbal skills, and visuospatial abilities. Factor analysis helps identify underlying variables, like Spearman’s “g” factor, which represents general intelligence. Correlations between test scores reveal these factors, with mental processing speed and working memory often linked to intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 2: Measuring Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-2/haai-post-lecture-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covers the concept of measuring intelligence, differentiating between physical, biological, and psychological dimensions. It outlines key scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, explaining their use in categorizing data, ranking, and performing statistical analysis. Various definitions of intelligence by figures like Spearman, Binet, and Wechsler emphasize reasoning, adaptation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological tests, like intelligence, aptitude, and personality tests, are standardized to assess behavior. Intelligence tests sample abilities such as verbal comprehension and visuospatial reasoning, with a positive correlation across tasks (positive manifold). Spearman’s principle highlights that all cognitive tests measure intelligence to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Introduction to the Concept of Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-1/haai-post-lecture-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
