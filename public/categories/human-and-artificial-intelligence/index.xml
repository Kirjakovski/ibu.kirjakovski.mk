      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;brief-course-description&#34;&gt;Brief course description:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This course explores the nature of intelligence, both human and artificial. Topics include theoretical frameworks, types of human intelligence, and the impact of biological and environmental factors on its development. The course also introduces artificial intelligence, examining functional aspects, machine learning, and large language models. By comparing human and artificial intelligence, students will explore concepts like machine consciousness and the ethical and societal implications of AI, fostering critical insights into this evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
