      <title>LECTURE 2: Measuring Intelligence</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covers the concept of measuring intelligence, differentiating between physical, biological, and psychological dimensions. It outlines key scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, explaining their use in categorizing data, ranking, and performing statistical analysis. Various definitions of intelligence by figures like Spearman, Binet, and Wechsler emphasize reasoning, adaptation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological tests, like intelligence, aptitude, and personality tests, are standardized to assess behavior. Intelligence tests sample abilities such as verbal comprehension and visuospatial reasoning, with a positive correlation across tasks (positive manifold). Spearmanâ€™s principle highlights that all cognitive tests measure intelligence to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Introduction to the Concept of Intelligence</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;brief-course-description&#34;&gt;Brief course description:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This course explores the nature of intelligence, both human and artificial. Topics include theoretical frameworks, types of human intelligence, and the impact of biological and environmental factors on its development. The course also introduces artificial intelligence, examining functional aspects, machine learning, and large language models. By comparing human and artificial intelligence, students will explore concepts like machine consciousness and the ethical and societal implications of AI, fostering critical insights into this evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
