      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture provided an overview of problem-solving and creativity from a cognitive psychology perspective. It discussed the Gestalt approach, which emphasizes how the representation of a problem in one&amp;rsquo;s mind influences the solution. The concept of insight, where a sudden realization leads to a reorganization of the mental representation, was explored. Obstacles to problem-solving, such as functional fixedness and mental set, were also covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The information-processing approach, as proposed by Newell and Simon, was introduced. This view sees problem-solving as navigating a problem space, with an initial state, goal state, and possible intermediate states. The importance of how a problem is stated and the use of analogies in problem-solving were highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture discussed the unique creativity and universality of human language as a communication system that employs sounds or symbols to express thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Language&amp;rsquo;s hierarchical structure enables the combination of smaller units, such as words, into complex expressions like phrases and sentences, following specific rules. Phonology defines the sound structures, while syntax organizes sentences based on grammatical rules, distinct from semantics, which determines meaning. Pragmatics addresses implied meanings in context, such as metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 7: Visual Imagery</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-7/cp-post-lecture-7/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture focused on visual and mental imagery as essential cognitive processes. Visual imagery is defined as seeing in the absence of a stimulus, while mental imagery encompasses recreating sensory experiences across all senses, including taste, smell, and touch. Debates on the necessity of imagery in thought have historical roots, with contrasting views from Aristotle, Galton, and Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive revolution introduced Paivio’s conceptual peg hypothesis and mental chronometry, emphasizing the role of spatial representations in memory and mental tasks like mental rotation. Kosslyn&amp;rsquo;s mental scanning experiments suggested spatial properties of imagery align with perception. However, Pylyshyn argued for propositional representation, challenging the spatial nature of mental images. Research compared imagery and perception through tasks like Kosslyn’s mental walk and Perky&amp;rsquo;s visual experiments, showing shared mechanisms but some distinctions. Neuroscientific evidence, including Kreiman’s discovery of imagery neurons and brain imaging studies, demonstrated overlapping but distinct brain areas for imagery and perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 6: Conceptual Knowledge</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-6/cp-post-lecture-6/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture on conceptual knowledge covered key aspects of how humans categorize and process information about objects and ideas. Concepts serve as mental representations for individual objects or abstract ideas, while categories group these objects based on shared features. The definitional approach to categorization relies on strict criteria, but the concept of family resemblance, proposed by Wittgenstein, suggests that category members can vary yet still share core similarities. Two major categorization approaches were discussed: the prototype approach, which uses an averaged representation of a category, and the exemplar approach, which considers multiple specific examples. While prototypes streamline category recognition, exemplars maintain detailed information, aiding in handling diverse categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Memory</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-5/cp-post-lecture-5/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture focused on memory processes within cognitive psychology, examining models, types, and key experiments. The Modal Model of Memory, by Atkinson and Shiffrin, introduces three stages: sensory memory, which briefly holds all incoming sensory input; short-term memory (STM), retaining small bits for about 15-20 seconds; and long-term memory (LTM), storing extensive information over years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STM was explored through experiments by Peterson and Peterson, who demonstrated STM’s limited duration and reliance on rehearsal, and by George Miller, who proposed its capacity as 5-9 items. Techniques like chunking were shown to extend STM’s capacity, while Luck and Vogel’s change detection method suggested STM’s retention of about four items. Working memory, distinct from STM, involves holding and manipulating information for complex tasks. Baddeley’s model includes the phonological loop for verbal data, the visuospatial sketchpad for spatial data, and the central executive for coordination. Later, the episodic buffer was added as a storage that interacts with LTM. Episodic and semantic memory are differentiated within LTM; episodic enables mental time travel to past experiences, while semantic involves general knowledge without specific recall. Studies on priming and procedural memory reveal the influence of implicit memory on behavior, even without conscious recall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Attention</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-4/cp-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attention, a key cognitive process, is essential for selecting and focusing on specific stimuli. William James described attention as the mind’s process of vividly highlighting certain elements while filtering others. Broadbent’s Filter Model emphasized that attention filters input based on physical characteristics, while Treisman modified this to suggest a more flexible approach, allowing some unattended information through if it’s significant, such as one’s name (the “cocktail party effect”). Later models proposed that attention could also occur at a later processing stage, selecting information by meaning. Processing capacity and perceptual load influence attention’s effectiveness; easier tasks allow for more distraction processing, while complex tasks limit this. Load Theory posits that high-load tasks consume all cognitive resources, reducing susceptibility to distractions, as shown in the Stroop Effect and Lavie’s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: Perception</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perception is the process by which the brain organizes and interprets sensory signals, enabling us to interact with our environment. It starts with sensation, where physical energy stimulates receptor cells, but perception involves interpreting these signals to understand shapes, objects, and events. Perception is influenced by both bottom-up processing, which begins with stimuli received by sensory organs, and top-down processing, shaped by prior knowledge and expectations. Challenges in perception arise due to the ambiguous nature of stimuli. Objects may be hidden, blurred, or viewed from different angles, making perception complex. Humans use unconscious inference, as proposed by Helmholtz, to perceive the most likely scenario based on sensory input. Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, and good continuation help organize visual information into coherent forms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. Neurons come in various types, including sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit signals from sensory organs to the brain, while motor neurons control movement. Interneurons facilitate communication between other neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the body’s organs and limbs to the CNS. The PNS is divided into the autonomic nervous system (ANS), controlling involuntary functions like digestion, and the sensory-somatic nervous system (SSNS), which manages voluntary movements and sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes and how the mind operates. It studies how the brain processes information, creates representations of the world, and helps us interact with it to achieve our goals. Cognitive psychology investigates processes like perception, memory, attention, language, reasoning, and decision-making. The brain is central to this, with its 86 billion neurons forming intricate connections. Cognitive processes are examined at three levels: the brain (physical structures and neural activity), the person (mental functions), and the group (social and cultural influences).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
