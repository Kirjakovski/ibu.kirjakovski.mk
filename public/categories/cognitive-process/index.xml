      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. Neurons come in various types, including sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit signals from sensory organs to the brain, while motor neurons control movement. Interneurons facilitate communication between other neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the bodyâ€™s organs and limbs to the CNS. The PNS is divided into the autonomic nervous system (ANS), controlling involuntary functions like digestion, and the sensory-somatic nervous system (SSNS), which manages voluntary movements and sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Introduction to Cognitive Psychology</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes and how the mind operates. It studies how the brain processes information, creates representations of the world, and helps us interact with it to achieve our goals. Cognitive psychology investigates processes like perception, memory, attention, language, reasoning, and decision-making. The brain is central to this, with its 86 billion neurons forming intricate connections. Cognitive processes are examined at three levels: the brain (physical structures and neural activity), the person (mental functions), and the group (social and cultural influences).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;brief-course-description&#34;&gt;Brief course description:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This course provides an overview of the fundamental processes involved in human cognition. Topics include perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity. The course also explores cognitive neuroscience, conceptual knowledge, visual imagery, and human intelligence. Special focus is given to cognitive disorders, offering insights into how these processes can malfunction. Students will gain a deeper understanding of how the brain supports mental functions and how cognitive processes impact everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
