      <title>LECTURE 8: Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-8/stat-post-lecture-8/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the fundamental concepts of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), a statistical method used to evaluate differences between the means of three or more independent groups. ANOVA operates under the null hypothesis that all groups share the same mean, and tests whether observed differences exceed what would be expected by chance. This is achieved by comparing two variance estimates: within-group variance (variation among scores within each group) and between-group variance (variation among group means).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 7: Introduction to t Tests</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-7/stat-post-lecture-7/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered the use of the t-test in hypothesis testing, focusing on its application when the population variance is unknown. The t-test compares sample means to a population mean or between groups. The session highlighted three types of t-tests: single sample, dependent means, and independent means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A t-test for a single sample compares a sample mean to a known population mean using an estimated population variance. A dependent means t-test examines differences within the same group by comparing scores across conditions or time points, using difference scores and assuming a mean difference of zero under the null hypothesis. Lastly, the independent means t-test compares means from two separate groups, relying on pooled variance estimates and assuming equal population variances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 6: Decision Errors, Effect Size, and Statistical Power</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-6/stat-post-lecture-6/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decision errors, effect size, and statistical power are key concepts in hypothesis testing. Decision errors include Type I errors, where the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected (false positive), and Type II errors, where it is wrongly retained (false negative). The probability of a Type I error aligns with the significance level (α), while the probability of a Type II error is denoted by beta (β). Statistical power, calculated as , is the likelihood of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the research hypothesis is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Hypothesis Tests with Means of Samples</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-5/stat-post-lecture-5/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduces hypothesis testing with sample means, focusing on the comparison of a sample to a population. It starts with the basics of the research and null hypotheses, where the research hypothesis suggests a specific effect or difference, while the null hypothesis assumes no effect. Hypothesis testing follows a structured process, requiring restating the question in hypothesis terms, identifying comparison distribution characteristics, determining a rejection cutoff, and calculating sample scores to decide on rejecting the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Introduction to Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-4/stat-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis testing is a systematic method to evaluate whether a sample’s results support a particular theory or innovation. It starts with forming hypotheses: the null hypothesis, which suggests no difference between groups, and the research (or alternative) hypothesis, which predicts a difference. Hypothesis testing follows a structured process. First, the question is reformulated as hypotheses about populations. Next, the characteristics of the comparison distribution are identified, typically assuming a normal distribution if the null hypothesis is true. Researchers then set a critical value, the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, often using conventional significance levels (e.g., p &amp;lt; .05 or p &amp;lt; .01).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: Basics of Inferential Statistics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-3/stat-post-lecture-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inferential statistics allow researchers to make general conclusions based on sample data, extending their findings beyond the participants in a study. Key concepts include scores, outliers, and measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode). Variability is measured using variance and standard deviation, which reflect how spread out the scores are from the mean. A normal distribution follows a bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric and unimodal. The central limit theorem explains that, with enough random influences, a precise normal curve results. Z-scores express how far a particular score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, offering insight into its position within the distribution. The normal curve allows us to predict the percentage of scores falling above or below any point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 2: Central Tendency and Variability</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-2/stat-post-lecture-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 20:13:54 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-2/stat-post-lecture-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered the concepts of central tendency and variability, essential tools in descriptive statistics. Central tendency refers to finding a single value that represents a set of scores. The three primary measures are the mean, mode, and median. The mean is the arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers, while the median is a more robust measure, representing the middle score when data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent score in a distribution and is typically used for nominal data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Measurement, Data, Distributions, Tables, and Graphs</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-1/stat-post-lecture-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered foundational concepts in statistics, focusing on measurement, data, distributions, tables, and graphs. It began by emphasizing the importance of statistics for conducting research, understanding scientific literature, and developing critical thinking. The field of statistics was divided into two main areas: descriptive statistics, which involves summarizing and organizing data, and inferential statistics, which focuses on drawing conclusions from sample data to generalize about populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Key definitions were introduced, such as data, variables, and different levels of measurement. Variables were classified as either discrete or continuous, and the types of data—qualitative and quantitative—were explained. The levels of measurement were outlined, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, each providing different levels of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that some of you are still sending your homework assignments through email for the Statistics course, despite my multiple reminders and instructions. Please remember that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u class=&#34;text-underline&#34;&gt;all homework must be submitted via Microsoft Forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The links to the assignment forms are available on my blog in each of the lecture posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won’t be accepting any assignments sent by email, so make sure to use the correct submission method. For this, you need a working university-issued &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u class=&#34;text-underline&#34;&gt;@ibu.edu.mk email address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This ensures that your work is properly tracked and graded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
