<p>Aggression represents intentional behavior aimed at causing physical or psychological harm, with violence as its most extreme form. The distinction between hostile aggression, driven by anger and intent to inflict pain, and instrumental aggression, used as a means to achieve other goals, underpins research in this domain. Evolutionary perspectives argue that men are predisposed to physical aggression to establish dominance and ensure reproductive success, whereas female aggression is often linked to offspring protection. Animal studies illustrate the interplay between innate tendencies and environmental influences, with evidence showing that social experiences can override aggressive instincts, though some forms of aggression remain biologically hardwired.</p>
<p>Hormonal factors, particularly testosterone, correlate with aggressive behavior, yet this relationship is complex and reciprocal—both affecting and being affected by behavior. Aggression is modulated by cultural norms and contexts. While humans possess the capacity for aggression, expression is shaped by learning, societal expectations, and environmental cues. Cultures of honor, often rooted in herding economies, show heightened sensitivity to provocation and increased violent responses.</p>
<p>Gender differences emerge in both the type and frequency of aggression. Men are more prone to physical aggression, whereas women exhibit higher levels of relational aggression, involving social manipulation. These differences diminish when situational factors provoke individuals equally, and cultural influences shape both forms.</p>
<p>Social-cognitive learning theory posits that aggression is acquired through observation and imitation, supported by Bandura’s Bobo Doll experiments. Media exposure to violence, particularly in children, increases aggressive thoughts and behaviors, with video games demonstrating notable effects.</p>
<p>Aggressive responses are heightened by physiological states such as alcohol intoxication, pain, and heat. Frustration-aggression theory suggests that obstacles to goals increase aggression, with further escalation when provoked or exposed to aggressive cues, such as weapons.</p>
<p>Efforts to diminish aggression reveal that punishment is effective only when immediate, consistent, and proportionate; otherwise, it may model aggression or foster retaliation. Catharsis, or venting anger, is ineffective and may exacerbate aggression. Constructive approaches, such as anger management, empathy training, and school-based prevention programs, are more successful in reducing aggressive behaviors. Social rejection is identified as a significant trigger for violence, emphasizing the value of interventions that foster inclusion and emotional regulation.</p>
