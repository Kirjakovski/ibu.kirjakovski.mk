<p>The lecture explores the foundations and determinants of prosocial behavior, beginning with a historical example of extreme altruism during the Chernobyl disaster, where volunteers risked their lives to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. Empirical research shows even young children display early signs of empathic concern and prosocial behavior, which increases with age. Prosocial behavior is defined as any act intended to benefit another, with altruism representing actions undertaken solely for others&rsquo; welfare, often at personal cost.</p>
<p>Several theoretical perspectives are presented. Evolutionary psychology explains helping through kin selection, suggesting behaviors favoring genetic relatives are favored by natural selection. Concepts such as inclusive fitness and the norm of reciprocity illustrate how helping relatives and reciprocating aid could enhance gene survival and group cohesion. Social exchange theory, in contrast, contends that people help when perceived rewards exceed costs, denying the existence of pure altruism. The empathy-altruism hypothesis introduces the idea that genuine empathy can motivate selfless helping, regardless of personal gain, as supported by experimental studies.</p>
<p>Individual differences, such as the altruistic personality, are acknowledged, but situational factors, gender, cultural norms, and mood also significantly influence helping. Men are described as more likely to engage in heroic, short-term helping, while women more often provide sustained support. Cultural values like simpatía promote helping in certain societies, and mood states—both positive and negative—can increase prosocial actions.</p>
<p>Situational variables are addressed, including the greater likelihood of helping in rural environments and among long-term community residents. The bystander effect demonstrates that increasing numbers of witnesses reduce individual intervention, explained by diffusion of responsibility. Media exposure to prosocial content can also increase helping.</p>
<p>Finally, the lecture discusses methods to promote prosocial behavior, such as increasing awareness of situational barriers and supporting voluntary engagement in helping activities, while noting the importance of balancing intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The interplay between positive psychology and social psychological perspectives highlights both personal virtues and situational influences in fostering prosocial actions.</p>
