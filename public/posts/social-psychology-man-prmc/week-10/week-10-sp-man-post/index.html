<p>Prejudice is defined as a hostile or negative attitude towards individuals based solely on their group membership, encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioral elements. Cognitively, the mind&rsquo;s natural tendency to categorize can lay the groundwork for prejudice. This often involves stereotypes: generalizations assigning traits to all members of a group, a mental shortcut described by Gordon Allport as &ldquo;the law of least effort,&rdquo; which can bias perception.</p>
<p>The affective, or emotional, component makes prejudice resistant to logical arguments. Behaviorally, prejudice can manifest as discrimination—unjustified negative actions. While linked, not all prejudiced attitudes translate into discriminatory behavior due to social norms or personal values. Uncovering hidden prejudices is complex; methods like the Implicit Association Test (IAT) aim to reveal subconscious biases, though its direct link to overt actions remains debated.</p>
<p>Prejudice significantly impacts its victims, potentially diminishing self-esteem and leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. Stereotype threat, the anxiety that one&rsquo;s actions might confirm a negative group stereotype, can also impair performance, though self-affirmation can mitigate this.</p>
<p>Multiple factors contribute to prejudice. Normative conformity, institutional practices, and Social Identity Theory—which fosters an &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; dynamic, in-group favoritism, and the perception of out-group homogeneity—all play roles. Realistic Conflict Theory adds that competition for scarce resources can intensify intergroup prejudice.</p>
<p>Efforts to reduce prejudice find that merely presenting contradictory information can be ineffective. The Contact Hypothesis offers a more promising approach: intergroup contact can diminish prejudice if conditions such as equal status, common goals fostering interdependence, and supportive social norms are met. Building on this, successful interventions require mutual dependence, shared objectives, equal standing, informal interaction, exposure to diverse out-group members, and community endorsement of equality.</p>
