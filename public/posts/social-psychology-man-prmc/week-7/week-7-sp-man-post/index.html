<p>Groups are defined as two or more individuals who interact and influence each other, often driven by shared goals and interdependence. People join groups for evolutionary advantages, goal achievement, identity formation, and adherence to social norms. Groups typically consist of three to six members and are shaped by social norms and roles, which guide behavior but can also lead to identity loss when roles are overly internalized.</p>
<p>Group cohesiveness fosters member retention and participation but may hinder performance if harmony is prioritized over effective solutions. While similarity enhances cohesiveness, diversity—across race, experience, and attitudes—can improve group performance.</p>
<p>The presence of others affects individual performance. Social facilitation enhances performance on simple tasks but impairs it on complex ones due to increased arousal. In contrast, social loafing occurs when individual efforts are less visible, leading to reduced effort on simple tasks but improved performance on complex ones. Deindividuation, often seen in crowds or online, reduces accountability and increases conformity to group norms.</p>
<p>Group decision-making can benefit from diverse input and expertise but is vulnerable to process loss, where poor communication or dominance by certain members impairs outcomes. Groups often fail to share unique information, though transactive memory can enhance collective recall. Groupthink arises when cohesion overrides critical thinking, leading to flawed decisions. It can be mitigated by impartiality, external input, and anonymous feedback.</p>
<p>Group polarization leads to more extreme decisions post-discussion. Leadership effectiveness depends on context; task-oriented leaders excel in high or low control situations, while relationship-oriented leaders thrive in moderate control settings. Cultural values influence leadership preferences, though charisma and teamwork are universally valued.</p>
<p>Social dilemmas highlight conflicts between individual and collective interests, as seen in the prisoner’s dilemma. Cooperation increases with trust and repeated interaction. Negotiation benefits from integrative solutions, where mutual gains are achieved through open communication and perspective-taking.</p>
