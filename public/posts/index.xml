      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brain consists of around 86 billion neurons, each forming thousands of connections, enabling rapid transmission of electrical signals. Neurons, the brain’s fundamental units, receive and send information through a complex network. Early theories proposed continuous neural networks, but later discoveries by Golgi and Cajal revealed that neurons are discrete units. The neuron comprises various parts like dendrites (receiving signals), axons (transmitting signals), and myelin sheaths (accelerating transmission). Neural communication occurs via electrochemical processes, following the “all-or-none” principle. When a neuron reaches a specific threshold, it triggers an action potential, sending signals down the axon. The synapse bridges neurons, with neurotransmitters carrying signals across the synaptic cleft to receptor sites. Neurotransmitters regulate various functions, influencing mood, memory, and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covers the concept of measuring intelligence, differentiating between physical, biological, and psychological dimensions. It outlines key scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, explaining their use in categorizing data, ranking, and performing statistical analysis. Various definitions of intelligence by figures like Spearman, Binet, and Wechsler emphasize reasoning, adaptation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological tests, like intelligence, aptitude, and personality tests, are standardized to assess behavior. Intelligence tests sample abilities such as verbal comprehension and visuospatial reasoning, with a positive correlation across tasks (positive manifold). Spearman’s principle highlights that all cognitive tests measure intelligence to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 2: Central Tendency and Variability</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-2/stat-post-lecture-2/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-2/stat-post-lecture-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered the concepts of central tendency and variability, essential tools in descriptive statistics. Central tendency refers to finding a single value that represents a set of scores. The three primary measures are the mean, mode, and median. The mean is the arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers, while the median is a more robust measure, representing the middle score when data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent score in a distribution and is typically used for nominal data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. Neurons come in various types, including sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit signals from sensory organs to the brain, while motor neurons control movement. Interneurons facilitate communication between other neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the body’s organs and limbs to the CNS. The PNS is divided into the autonomic nervous system (ANS), controlling involuntary functions like digestion, and the sensory-somatic nervous system (SSNS), which manages voluntary movements and sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Introduction to the Concept of Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-1/haai-post-lecture-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered foundational concepts in statistics, focusing on measurement, data, distributions, tables, and graphs. It began by emphasizing the importance of statistics for conducting research, understanding scientific literature, and developing critical thinking. The field of statistics was divided into two main areas: descriptive statistics, which involves summarizing and organizing data, and inferential statistics, which focuses on drawing conclusions from sample data to generalize about populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Key definitions were introduced, such as data, variables, and different levels of measurement. Variables were classified as either discrete or continuous, and the types of data—qualitative and quantitative—were explained. The levels of measurement were outlined, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, each providing different levels of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes and how the mind operates. It studies how the brain processes information, creates representations of the world, and helps us interact with it to achieve our goals. Cognitive psychology investigates processes like perception, memory, attention, language, reasoning, and decision-making. The brain is central to this, with its 86 billion neurons forming intricate connections. Cognitive processes are examined at three levels: the brain (physical structures and neural activity), the person (mental functions), and the group (social and cultural influences).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Psychology as Science</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/introduction-to-psychology/lecture-1/itp-post-lecture-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 12:47:01 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. It systematically examines how the brain operates, its structure, and how it influences observable actions. To understand behavior, psychologists analyze three levels: the brain, the individual, and group dynamics. Psychological inquiry often contrasts scientific methods with intuition. Science relies on empirical data and systematic experimentation, while intuition involves more automatic and emotional thinking. Psychologists prefer empirical methods to ensure objectivity and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Students,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my IBU Blog. We are about to begin a new 2024/2025 academic year at the International Balkan University. I created this blog to facilitate our communication and to reduce the number of emails. This should help us prevent misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When many individuals attempt to communicate via email, it can become confusing and slow. This happens because a single email account can become overloaded, making it difficult to keep track of all the messages. Teachers are also occupied with other responsibilities and may not always be able to respond promptly. That&amp;rsquo;s why I chose to consolidate all my updates in one place online—this blog—for everyone to access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
