<p>A group is defined as two or more individuals who interact and influence each other, often forming around shared goals, needs, or identities. Evolutionarily, groups enhanced survival by facilitating cooperation in tasks like hunting and caregiving. They also provide social norms and roles that guide behavior, though these can sometimes suppress individuality.</p>
<p>Groups typically consist of three to six members and are shaped by norms, roles, cohesiveness, and diversity. While cohesiveness strengthens bonds, it can hinder performance if harmony is prioritized over effective decision-making. Diversity, especially in race and experience, can enhance group outcomes.</p>
<p>The presence of others affects performance. Social facilitation improves performance on simple tasks but impairs it on complex ones due to increased arousal. In contrast, social loafing occurs when individual efforts are less visible, leading to reduced motivation. Deindividuation, often seen in crowds or online, reduces accountability and increases conformity to group norms.</p>
<p>Group decision-making can benefit from diverse input but is vulnerable to process loss, where poor communication or dominance by certain members impairs outcomes. Groupthink arises when cohesion overrides critical thinking, while group polarization pushes decisions toward extremes. Remedies include encouraging dissent and seeking outside opinions.</p>
<p>Leadership effectiveness depends more on context than personality. Transactional leaders focus on short-term goals, while transformational leaders inspire long-term vision. Fiedler’s contingency theory suggests task-oriented leaders excel in high or low control situations, while relationship-oriented leaders thrive in moderate control settings. Cultural values also shape leadership preferences.</p>
<p>Social dilemmas highlight conflicts between individual and collective interests, as seen in the prisoner’s dilemma. Cooperation increases with trust and repeated interaction. Negotiation, especially when integrative, allows both sides to reach mutually beneficial outcomes by understanding each other’s priorities.</p>
