<p>The lecture explores the dynamics of attraction and romantic relationships through empirical findings and theoretical frameworks in social psychology. It outlines factors predicting attraction, beginning with the propinquity effect, where frequent interaction increases the likelihood of forming relationships, influenced by both physical and functional distance. Mere exposure enhances liking, unless the person possesses negative qualities. Similarity—across attitudes, interests, appearance, and even genetics—is emphasized, with perceived similarity shown as a stronger predictor of attraction than actual similarity, particularly for long-term bonds. Reciprocal liking can override differences, and both sexes value physical attractiveness in practice, despite reported differences.</p>
<p>Standards of beauty show cross-cultural consistency, with preferences for facial symmetry and “average” features linked to perceptions of good genes. Familiarity, resulting from exposure, similarity, and reciprocal liking, is central to attraction. Attractive individuals benefit from the halo effect, whereby positive traits are attributed to them based on appearance alone, influencing outcomes such as income and professional evaluations.</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychology posits distinct mate preferences for men and women, rooted in reproductive strategies—men prioritizing attractiveness, women resourcefulness—with female selectivity heightened near peak fertility. Technological advances impact social connection, as the presence of mobile devices reduces feelings of closeness and empathy. In online dating, while large pools and compatibility algorithms are touted, actual relationship outcomes do not surpass traditional methods, and profile deception is common.</p>
<p>Love is characterized by companionate and passionate forms, with cultural norms shaping experiences and expectations. Attachment styles, formed in early childhood, inform adult relationship patterns but are not deterministic. Neuroimaging reveals specific brain regions activated by romantic love, analogous to reward and motivation systems.</p>
<p>Relationship satisfaction is examined through social exchange theory, the investment model, and equity theory, highlighting the roles of perceived rewards, costs, alternatives, investments, and fairness. Relationship dissolution is conceptualized as a process with distinct stages, with communication styles, especially the presence of criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling, predicting outcomes. The breakup experience varies by one’s role in the process, with investment levels influencing post-breakup interactions.</p>
