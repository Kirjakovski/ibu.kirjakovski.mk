<p>The lecture explores ethics, a philosophical branch examining moral judgments and their nature, divided into subfields like normative, applied, metaethics, and descriptive ethics. Professional ethics dictate acceptable conduct within professions, often guided by a code of ethics. These codes provide guidelines for ethical conduct, decision-making, and professional behavior, ensuring accountability and client welfare. Ethical dilemmas, such as confidentiality versus the duty to warn, illustrate the challenges faced by professionals. Common themes in ethics codes include client welfare, competence, cultural respect, and confidentiality. However, these codes have limitations, being broad and sometimes conflicting with laws or cultural norms.</p>
<p>Ethics differ from laws; ethics are aspirational, while laws are enforceable. Ethical standards often surpass legal requirements, leading to potential conflicts. The lecture distinguishes between mandatory ethics, focusing on compliance, and aspirational ethics, aiming for the highest standards. Ethical decision-making models, such as principle and virtue ethics, guide professionals through dilemmas by considering cultural factors, consulting codes, and evaluating actions. Six moral principles—autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, fidelity, and veracity—are crucial in decision-making.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring ensures adherence to ethical standards, with licensing boards and ethics committees playing key roles. Despite the importance of ethics codes, they are insufficient alone; critical thinking, self-reflection, and consultation are essential for ethical practice.</p>
