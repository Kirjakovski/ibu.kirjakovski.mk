<p>This lecture on sensation and perception covered the processes that enable us to sense and interpret our environment. Sensation involves detecting physical energy through receptor cells before the brain organizes and interprets it. Perception is the neural process of organizing sensory input into coherent units, identifying objects and locations. We explored various senses beyond sight, including balance, body position, pain, and temperature. Psychophysics was introduced, discussing thresholds for detecting stimuli and how subliminal messaging works. Signal Detection Theory explained how people discern signals amid noise, highlighting sensitivity and bias.</p>
<p>Visual processing methods were divided into bottom-up (raw data) and top-down (using prior knowledge) processes. Attention, motivation, and personal experiences influence perception. Key visual concepts such as light waves, visible spectrum, and the anatomy of the eye were discussed, alongside theories on color vision and conditions like color blindness. Sound waves, hearing anatomy, and the psychology of sound were explained, detailing loudness, pitch, and localization. Other senses, such as taste, smell, and touch, including temperature and pain perception, were also examined. Visual organization involved Gestalt principles, which explain how we group sensory characteristics, as well as perceptual constancy, allowing us to recognize objects regardless of variations in viewpoint or lighting. The lecture also introduced depth perception, with binocular and monocular cues helping us judge distances. Finally, common perceptual phenomena like inattentional and change blindness highlighted the limits of attention in visual perception.</p>
