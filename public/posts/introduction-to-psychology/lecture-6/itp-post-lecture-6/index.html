<p>The lecture on &ldquo;Emotion and Motivation&rdquo; explored the mechanisms driving behavior and emotional responses. Motivation was explained as the driving force behind goal-directed behavior, influenced by intrinsic (internal) or extrinsic (external) factors, with the overjustification effect highlighting how extrinsic rewards can diminish intrinsic motivation. Key motivational theories included the instinct theory, drive theory, and arousal theory. Instincts, as innate behaviors supporting survival, were contrasted with learned habits that develop from repeated behaviors reducing physiological drives. Arousal theory posits that individuals seek an optimal level of stimulation, with performance linked to arousal complexity, as illustrated by the Yerkes-Dodson law.</p>
<p>Emotions were defined as psychological states involving subjective experiences, physiological arousal, cognitive processes, and expressive behaviors. Darwin&rsquo;s evolutionary perspective emphasized emotions as adaptive mechanisms aiding survival and communication. Basic emotions, such as happiness, anger, and fear, were discussed alongside critiques and alternative models like the circumplex model of affect, which frames emotions on continua of arousal and pleasure. Various emotional theories, such as James–Lange, Cannon–Bard, and Schachter-Singer, offered insights into how emotions arise from physiological responses, brain activity, and cognitive appraisal. Cultural influences on emotional expression were noted, with display rules highlighting the social regulation of emotional display.</p>
<p>Biological underpinnings of emotion involved the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, central to processing and regulating emotions. The universality of basic emotional expressions was acknowledged, despite cultural and contextual variations. The lecture concluded with the significance of emotions in motivating behavior and the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors in shaping emotional experiences.</p>
