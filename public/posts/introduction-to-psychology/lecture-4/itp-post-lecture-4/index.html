<p>The lecture introduces the concept of learning, defined as acquiring lasting knowledge or behaviors through experience. It contrasts innate behavior with learned behavior, emphasizing that most behaviors are a mix of both. Two main types of learning are discussed: associative and nonassociative. Associative learning, such as classical conditioning, involves linking one stimulus with another, demonstrated by Pavlov’s dog experiments. Phases of classical conditioning, including acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery, illustrate how conditioned responses develop and fade over time. Nonassociative learning includes habituation and sensitization, where reactions to a stimulus either decrease or increase with repeated exposure.</p>
<p>Operant conditioning, pioneered by B.F. Skinner, focuses on the consequences of voluntary actions. Behaviors reinforced with positive or negative outcomes are more likely to recur, while those with punishments are less likely. Reinforcement schedules, like fixed or variable intervals and ratios, shape consistent or sporadic behavior patterns. The lecture also covers cognitive learning, such as latent and insight learning, where knowledge can be retained for later use without immediate application. Observational learning, or learning by watching others, is highlighted through Bandura’s studies, illustrating the impact of models on behavior. The lecture concludes by examining the implications of learning from others, which can lead to both positive and negative behaviors.</p>
