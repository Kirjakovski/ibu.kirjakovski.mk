<p>This lecture examines conceptual knowledge, the system that enables people to recognize objects and make inferences about their properties. This knowledge is organized into concepts (mental representations, like &ldquo;cat&rdquo;) and categories (groups of objects, like &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Early attempts to categorize using rigid definitions (the definitional approach) were found to be inadequate, as many category members (like different types of chairs) do not meet all criteria. This led to the <strong>Prototype Approach</strong>, which posits that categories are formed around a single &ldquo;average&rdquo; member, or prototype. New items are judged based on their &ldquo;typicality,&rdquo; or resemblance to this prototype. This explains the &ldquo;typicality effect,&rdquo; where highly typical objects (like &ldquo;sparrow&rdquo; for &ldquo;bird&rdquo;) are verified more rapidly than atypical ones (like &ldquo;penguin&rdquo;).</p>
<p>An alternative, the <strong>Exemplar Approach</strong>, suggests categorization involves comparing new items not to one average, but to many <em>specific</em> examples (exemplars) previously encountered. It is likely that people use both prototypes and exemplars.</p>
<p>Categories are also organized hierarchically into global (e.g., &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo;), basic (e.g., &ldquo;Car&rdquo;), and specific (e.g., &ldquo;Ford&rdquo;) levels. The basic level is considered psychologically special because it offers the most informative balance—going higher loses too much detail, while going lower adds too little.</p>
<p>Models explaining this mental organization include the <strong>Semantic Network Approach</strong> (Collins and Quillian), which mapped concepts in a hierarchy using &ldquo;cognitive economy&rdquo; and &ldquo;spreading activation.&rdquo; A more dynamic <strong>Connectionist Approach</strong> (PDP) uses neural-like networks where knowledge is represented by a <em>distributed pattern</em> of activity, allowing for gradual learning and degradation.</p>
<p>Finally, in the brain, the <strong>Embodied Approach</strong> suggests that our knowledge of concepts is based on reactivating the sensory and motor processes that occur when we interact with an object. The <strong>Hub and Spoke Model</strong> integrates these ideas, proposing that a central &ldquo;hub&rdquo; (in the Anterior Temporal Lobe) coordinates and integrates information from specialized &ldquo;spokes&rdquo; (sensory, motor, etc.) to form a complete concept.</p>
