<p>The lecture explored a range of cognitive disorders, detailing their origins, characteristics, and implications. Synesthesia was presented as a unique condition where sensory input in one modality evokes experiences in another. It is typically unidirectional, with varying prevalence among individuals. Blindsight, resulting from primary visual cortex damage, allows patients to detect visual stimuli in impaired regions despite nominal vision loss.</p>
<p>Unilateral spatial neglect, often caused by strokes, involves an inability to respond to stimuli from one side of space, influenced by spatial frameworks. Visual agnosias, including prosopagnosia, disrupt object and face recognition despite intact sensory function. Patients often compensate using non-visual cues, with specific brain areas like the fusiform face area implicated.</p>
<p>Memory disorders like amnesia were also discussed, divided into organic and psychogenic types. Conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Korsakoff syndrome, and herpes simplex encephalitis were highlighted as causes, with distinctions between anterograde and retrograde amnesia underscoring memory dysfunction’s complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, language disorders such as aphasia were categorized based on their impact on speech comprehension or production. Broca’s aphasia involves effortful speech, while Wernicke’s aphasia features fluent but incomprehensible speech. These deficits underscore the brain’s intricate role in cognitive and linguistic processes.</p>
