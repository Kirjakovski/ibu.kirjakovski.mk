Perceptual and attentional disorders provide insight into specialized brain functions. Synesthesia is a condition where sensory input in one modality triggers an automatic experience in another, such as seeing colors while hearing sounds. Conversely, blindsight involves damage to the primary visual cortex; patients detect visual stimuli within a scotoma despite a nominal loss of vision. Unilateral spatial neglect, frequently observed following right-hemisphere strokes, results in the failure to attend to stimuli on one side of space.

<p>The &ldquo;Cognitive Disorders&rdquo; lecture systematically explores the disruptions of human cognitive processes typically resulting from brain injury, cardiovascular events, or degenerative conditions. Perceptual and attentional disorders provide insight into specialized brain functions. Synesthesia is a condition where sensory input in one modality triggers an automatic experience in another, such as seeing colors while hearing sounds. Conversely, blindsight involves damage to the primary visual cortex; patients detect visual stimuli within a scotoma despite a nominal loss of vision. Unilateral spatial neglect, frequently observed following right-hemisphere strokes, results in the failure to attend to stimuli on one side of space. Visual agnosia further illustrates cognitive dissociation; patients possess intact sensory processes but cannot recognize objects. Specific variations include form agnosia, integrative agnosia, and prosopagnosia, which is the specialized inability to recognize faces.</p>
<p>Amnesia represents a pathological impairment of memory, categorized as either organic or psychogenic. Alzheimer’s disease serves as the primary cause of organic amnesia, though other causes include Korsakoff syndrome and viral encephalitis. These impairments are distinguished by temporal direction: anterograde amnesia prevents the formation of new memories post-onset, while retrograde amnesia affects the recall of events prior to the disorder.</p>
<p>The study of language disorders focuses on aphasias acquired through lesions. Broca’s aphasia manifests as effortful, halting speech with intact comprehension. In contrast, Wernicke’s aphasia is characterized by fluent speech but impaired language comprehension. Global aphasia occurs when both production and perception are compromised, highlighting the critical neural pathways required for communication.</p>
