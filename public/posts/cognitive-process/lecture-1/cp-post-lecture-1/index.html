<p>Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes and how the mind operates. It studies how the brain processes information, creates representations of the world, and helps us interact with it to achieve our goals. Cognitive psychology investigates processes like perception, memory, attention, language, reasoning, and decision-making. The brain is central to this, with its 86 billion neurons forming intricate connections. Cognitive processes are examined at three levels: the brain (physical structures and neural activity), the person (mental functions), and the group (social and cultural influences).</p>
<p>Historically, psychology evolved from early philosophical ideas. Structuralism, introduced by Wundt, aimed to break consciousness into its basic elements, while Jamesâ€™s functionalism focused on how the mind helps individuals adapt to their environment. Gestalt psychology emphasized that perceptions are more than the sum of their parts. Behaviorism, led by figures like Watson and Skinner, shifted focus to observable behavior, rejecting the study of mental processes. The cognitive revolution in the 1950s and 60s, sparked by advancements in computer science, revived interest in mental processes. Cognitive psychologists began comparing the mind to a computer, focusing on how information is stored, processed, and retrieved. This era also marked the birth of cognitive neuroscience, which links brain function with cognitive processes.</p>
<p>Modern cognitive psychology applies these principles to real-world situations, examining how we perceive, learn, and remember information. Techniques like brain imaging and electrophysiology have furthered our understanding of how the brain supports these mental activities.</p>
