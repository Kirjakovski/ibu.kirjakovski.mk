<p>The lecture on &ldquo;Judgment, Decisions, and Reasoning&rdquo; explored how humans process information to draw conclusions and make choices. Judgment involves forming opinions, reasoning uses logic to extend knowledge, and decisions require selecting among alternatives.</p>
<p>Inductive Reasoning derives general conclusions from specific observations, though conclusions remain probabilistic. Factors like the representativeness of observations, number of instances, and quality of evidence influence its reliability. Heuristics, such as availability (ease of recall) and representativeness (similarity to stereotypes), simplify decision-making but can cause errors.</p>
<p>Deductive Reasoning ensures conclusions follow logically from premises. Syllogisms illustrate this, with premises leading to valid or invalid conclusions, depending on logical structure. Errors include belief bias and failure to consider base rates. Mental models help visualize logical problems, though their complexity can challenge reasoning accuracy.</p>
<p>Decision-Making balances expected utility with emotional influences. Emotions, both anticipated and incidental, shape choices, often causing biases. Context matters, as prior experiences, framing effects, and decision fatigue affect outcomes. Neuroeconomics reveals how emotional and rational brain systems interact in choice-making. The Dual Systems Approach highlights two thinking modes: System 1 (fast, intuitive, error-prone) and System 2 (slow, analytical, effortful). Recognizing these processes enhances reasoning, critical thinking, and informed decision-making.</p>
