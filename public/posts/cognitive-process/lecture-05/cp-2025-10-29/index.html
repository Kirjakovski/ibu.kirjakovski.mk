<p>Memory is the process of retaining, retrieving, and using information after the original stimulus is gone. The classic Modal Model of Memory breaks this process into three structural stages. First, Sensory Memory briefly holds all incoming sensory information for less than a second. Sperling&rsquo;s partial report experiments demonstrated that while sensory memory has a large capacity, the information fades rapidly.</p>
<p>Information attended to moves into Short-Term Memory (STM), a store with a limited duration and capacity. Without rehearsal, information in STM lasts only about 15-20 seconds. While traditionally thought to hold &ldquo;seven plus or minus two&rdquo; items, modern change detection studies suggest the capacity is closer to four items. This capacity is also affected by information complexity, not just item count. However, capacity can be expanded by chunking—grouping small units into larger, meaningful ones. The concept of STM was refined into Working Memory (WM), which is not just a passive store, but an active system for manipulating information for complex tasks. This multi-component model includes the Phonological Loop for verbal and auditory information and the Visuospatial Sketch Pad for visual and spatial information. These &ldquo;slave systems&rdquo; are coordinated by the Central Executive, which directs attention.</p>
<p>Evidence for the distinction between STM and Long-Term Memory (LTM)—the vast, long-duration store—comes from the serial position curve. The primacy effect (better recall for early items) occurs because items were rehearsed and sent to LTM. The recency effect (better recall for late items) occurs because items are still in STM. This is supported by neuropsychological cases like H.M., who had an impaired LTM but functional STM. LTM itself is divided into Explicit (conscious) memory and Implicit (unconscious) memory. Explicit memory includes Episodic memory (personal events, involving &ldquo;mental time travel&rdquo;) and Semantic memory (facts and knowledge). Implicit memory includes Procedural memory (skills like mirror drawing) and Priming (when prior exposure influences a response).</p>
