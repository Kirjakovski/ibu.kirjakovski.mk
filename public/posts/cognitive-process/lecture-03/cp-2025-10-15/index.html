<p>Perception is the complex process of organizing and interpreting sensory information to understand the environment, going beyond simple sensation, which is the initial neural response to physical energy. This interpretive process is challenging because the sensory information received by our receptors is often ambiguous. For instance, a single two-dimensional image on the retina could correspond to numerous three-dimensional objects in the world. Furthermore, objects can be partially hidden, blurred, or viewed from various angles, yet we can typically still identify them.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, the brain uses two types of processing. Bottom-up processing begins with the raw sensory data, while top-down processing utilizes existing knowledge, expectations, and context to interpret that data. This is evident in how we perceive objects differently depending on the scene they are in, or how we segment continuous speech into individual words based on our knowledge of a language.</p>
<p>Several theories explain how the brain organizes perception. Helmholtz&rsquo;s theory of unconscious inference suggests we perceive the object most likely to have caused the sensory pattern. Gestalt psychologists identified principles like proximity, similarity, and good continuation, which describe how our minds automatically group elements to form coherent wholes. Perception is also shaped by environmental regularities, such as the common occurrence of vertical and horizontal lines and our assumption that light comes from above.</p>
<p>Modern approaches, like Bayesian inference, formalize this by proposing that perception is a probabilistic process, combining prior beliefs with the likelihood of current sensory evidence. The brain&rsquo;s structure itself is shaped by experience through a process called experience-dependent plasticity. Finally, perception is intrinsically linked to action, involving two distinct neural pathways: a &ldquo;what&rdquo; stream for identifying objects and a &ldquo;where/how&rdquo; stream for guiding interaction with them.</p>
