<p>The lecture focused on visual and mental imagery as essential cognitive processes. Visual imagery is defined as seeing in the absence of a stimulus, while mental imagery encompasses recreating sensory experiences across all senses, including taste, smell, and touch. Debates on the necessity of imagery in thought have historical roots, with contrasting views from Aristotle, Galton, and Watson.</p>
<p>The cognitive revolution introduced Paivio’s conceptual peg hypothesis and mental chronometry, emphasizing the role of spatial representations in memory and mental tasks like mental rotation. Kosslyn&rsquo;s mental scanning experiments suggested spatial properties of imagery align with perception. However, Pylyshyn argued for propositional representation, challenging the spatial nature of mental images. Research compared imagery and perception through tasks like Kosslyn’s mental walk and Perky&rsquo;s visual experiments, showing shared mechanisms but some distinctions. Neuroscientific evidence, including Kreiman’s discovery of imagery neurons and brain imaging studies, demonstrated overlapping but distinct brain areas for imagery and perception.</p>
<p>Neuropsychological studies highlighted dissociations between imagery and perception, with conditions where one is impaired but not the other. This reinforced the view that while perception and imagery share mechanisms, they also involve independent processes. Finally, practical applications of imagery in memory improvement were discussed, including the method of loci and the pegword technique. These strategies leverage spatial and visual associations to enhance recall.</p>
