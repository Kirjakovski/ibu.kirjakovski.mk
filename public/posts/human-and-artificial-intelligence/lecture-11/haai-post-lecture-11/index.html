<p>The lecture on &ldquo;Machine Consciousness&rdquo; explored the nature of consciousness, its dimensions, and its relevance to both human cognition and artificial intelligence. Consciousness was defined as the state of awareness and the ability to experience thoughts and sensations, distinguished by phenomenal (subjective experiences) and access (reportable and processable information) consciousness. Key philosophical frameworks included Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s emphasis on the subjectivity of experience and David Chalmers&rsquo; distinction between the easy (cognitive functions) and hard (subjective experience) problems of consciousness.</p>
<p>Theoretical models like Higher-Order Theories, Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, and Predictive Processing were discussed, each offering perspectives on how consciousness arises, emphasizing processes like meta-representation, global information sharing, and integrated complexity. The practical application of these theories to AI systems raised questions about replicating human-like awareness and developing systems capable of autonomous reasoning and environmental interaction.</p>
<p>The lecture delved into the technical aspects of implementing machine consciousness, highlighting cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R and SOAR), neural networks, and hybrid systems combining symbolic and connectionist approaches. These technologies enable advanced functions like adaptive learning, decision-making, and sensory-motor integration.</p>
<p>Finally, ethical considerations were underscored, questioning the rights and responsibilities of conscious machines, potential biases in AI, and the societal implications of advanced AI systems. The session concluded with a look at future prospects, including AI-enhanced human cognition, the risks of superintelligence, and the necessity for global regulation to balance innovation with ethical integrity.</p>
