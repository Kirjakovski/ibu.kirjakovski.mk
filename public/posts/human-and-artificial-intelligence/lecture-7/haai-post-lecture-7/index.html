<p>The lecture introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the development of machines capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human and animal intelligence, such as reasoning, perception, planning, and motor control. AI applications span diverse fields, from daily life (smart homes, autonomous cars) to specialized domains like finance, healthcare, robotics, and creative arts.</p>
<p>It outlined key types of AI, including symbolic AI, artificial neural networks, evolutionary programming, cellular automata, and dynamical systems. Symbolic AI focuses on logic-based problem solving, while neural networks mimic brain functions for pattern recognition. Evolutionary programming imitates biological evolution, cellular automata explore simple rule-based models, and dynamical systems study time-dependent changes. The historical context highlighted Ada Lovelace&rsquo;s foundational ideas, Alan Turing’s universal machine and Turing Test, and McCulloch-Pitts’ neuron-based computation models. Early milestones showcased AI’s ability to solve logical problems, learn from data, and mimic neural patterns, with cybernetics emphasizing feedback loops and adaptive systems.</p>
<p>AI approaches include acting humanly (Turing Test), thinking humanly (cognitive science), thinking rationally (logic-based reasoning), and acting rationally (rational agents maximizing outcomes under uncertainty). The lecture also addressed ethical concerns, such as value alignment, where machines’ objectives must align with human values, and risks like autonomous weapons, biased decisions, and AI&rsquo;s societal impact. The narrative closed with the dual nature of AI, emphasizing its potential benefits in improving efficiency and innovation, while cautioning against its misuse or unintended consequences.</p>
