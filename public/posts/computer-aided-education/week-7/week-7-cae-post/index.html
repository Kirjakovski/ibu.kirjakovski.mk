<p>The lecture focused on the role of color in computer-aided education, emphasizing its impact on user engagement, comprehension, and interface design. Color is defined through three variables: hue, saturation, and intensity. Computers use the RGB model to generate colors, and effective use of color can attract attention, reinforce key points, and organize information.</p>
<p>Color must be applied systematically to support learning objectives. Random or excessive use can distract or confuse learners. Consistency in color usage helps users develop a visual code, improving navigation and understanding. Designers are advised to limit the number of colors, maintain high contrast for readability, and consider color blindness by testing interfaces in monochrome. Cultural differences influence color perception, making audience testing essential. Specific colors carry common associations—red for danger, green for calm—but these meanings vary. Highlighting with color, especially when combined with graphics or layout elements, enhances clarity and focus.</p>
<p>Text readability remains a priority; black text on a white background is standard, but color can be used for headings, links, and labels if contrast is maintained. Designers should consider user preferences and allow customization when possible to reduce cognitive load. Color combinations should be chosen for contrast and comfort, avoiding fully saturated extremes. In graphics and data visualization, color adds value by distinguishing elements and improving comprehension. Tools like palette generators can aid in selecting visually equidistant colors to ensure clarity. Overall, thoughtful color use enhances the effectiveness of computer-based learning materials.</p>
