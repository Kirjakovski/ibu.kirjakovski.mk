      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture explored intelligence development, highlighting factors shaping human intelligence. In infancy, intelligence manifests through early learning, such as visual preferences, sound recognition, and novelty response. Research methods in infant intelligence, including observation and brain imaging, help understand cognitive progress and sensitivity to environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of sensitive periods was discussed, emphasizing key phases when environmental inputs, like social interactions or sensory experiences, significantly shape cognitive abilities. Physical aspects such as prenatal health, nutrition, and exposure to pollutants were outlined for their impact on brain development and cognitive functions. Social influences on intelligence, including socioeconomic status and parental education, further underscore environmental impact. Early childhood programs and quality education improve cognitive abilities and lay foundations for future learning. Overall, intelligence emerges through a dynamic interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with both early interventions and sustained educational opportunities playing essential roles in fostering cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Hypothesis Tests with Means of Samples</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-5/stat-post-lecture-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 13:54:44 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-5/stat-post-lecture-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduces hypothesis testing with sample means, focusing on the comparison of a sample to a population. It starts with the basics of the research and null hypotheses, where the research hypothesis suggests a specific effect or difference, while the null hypothesis assumes no effect. Hypothesis testing follows a structured process, requiring restating the question in hypothesis terms, identifying comparison distribution characteristics, determining a rejection cutoff, and calculating sample scores to decide on rejecting the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 5: Memory</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-5/cp-post-lecture-5/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/cognitive-process/lecture-5/cp-post-lecture-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture focused on memory processes within cognitive psychology, examining models, types, and key experiments. The Modal Model of Memory, by Atkinson and Shiffrin, introduces three stages: sensory memory, which briefly holds all incoming sensory input; short-term memory (STM), retaining small bits for about 15-20 seconds; and long-term memory (LTM), storing extensive information over years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STM was explored through experiments by Peterson and Peterson, who demonstrated STM’s limited duration and reliance on rehearsal, and by George Miller, who proposed its capacity as 5-9 items. Techniques like chunking were shown to extend STM’s capacity, while Luck and Vogel’s change detection method suggested STM’s retention of about four items. Working memory, distinct from STM, involves holding and manipulating information for complex tasks. Baddeley’s model includes the phonological loop for verbal data, the visuospatial sketchpad for spatial data, and the central executive for coordination. Later, the episodic buffer was added as a storage that interacts with LTM. Episodic and semantic memory are differentiated within LTM; episodic enables mental time travel to past experiences, while semantic involves general knowledge without specific recall. Studies on priming and procedural memory reveal the influence of implicit memory on behavior, even without conscious recall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Learning</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/introduction-to-psychology/lecture-4/itp-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/introduction-to-psychology/lecture-4/itp-post-lecture-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduces the concept of learning, defined as acquiring lasting knowledge or behaviors through experience. It contrasts innate behavior with learned behavior, emphasizing that most behaviors are a mix of both. Two main types of learning are discussed: associative and nonassociative. Associative learning, such as classical conditioning, involves linking one stimulus with another, demonstrated by Pavlov’s dog experiments. Phases of classical conditioning, including acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery, illustrate how conditioned responses develop and fade over time. Nonassociative learning includes habituation and sensitization, where reactions to a stimulus either decrease or increase with repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Kinds of Human Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-4/haai-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/human-and-artificial-intelligence/lecture-4/haai-post-lecture-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture focused on alternative models of intelligence beyond the traditional “g-factor.” This general intelligence factor, suggested by Charles Spearman, proposes that cognitive abilities correlate with one another, indicating a common underlying intelligence. However, theories like Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences argue for distinct, independent intelligences such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, and spatial, though critics challenge its lack of empirical support and practical application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emotional Intelligence (EI), popularized by Salovey, Mayer, and later Goleman, involves the capacity to perceive, use, and regulate emotions. EI is linked to various life domains, from social relationships to health. Tests like the MSCEIT assess EI based on the four-branch model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Introduction to Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-4/stat-post-lecture-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis testing is a systematic method to evaluate whether a sample’s results support a particular theory or innovation. It starts with forming hypotheses: the null hypothesis, which suggests no difference between groups, and the research (or alternative) hypothesis, which predicts a difference. Hypothesis testing follows a structured process. First, the question is reformulated as hypotheses about populations. Next, the characteristics of the comparison distribution are identified, typically assuming a normal distribution if the null hypothesis is true. Researchers then set a critical value, the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, often using conventional significance levels (e.g., p &amp;lt; .05 or p &amp;lt; .01).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 4: Attention</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attention, a key cognitive process, is essential for selecting and focusing on specific stimuli. William James described attention as the mind’s process of vividly highlighting certain elements while filtering others. Broadbent’s Filter Model emphasized that attention filters input based on physical characteristics, while Treisman modified this to suggest a more flexible approach, allowing some unattended information through if it’s significant, such as one’s name (the “cocktail party effect”). Later models proposed that attention could also occur at a later processing stage, selecting information by meaning. Processing capacity and perceptual load influence attention’s effectiveness; easier tasks allow for more distraction processing, while complex tasks limit this. Load Theory posits that high-load tasks consume all cognitive resources, reducing susceptibility to distractions, as shown in the Stroop Effect and Lavie’s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lecture on sensation and perception covered the processes that enable us to sense and interpret our environment. Sensation involves detecting physical energy through receptor cells before the brain organizes and interprets it. Perception is the neural process of organizing sensory input into coherent units, identifying objects and locations. We explored various senses beyond sight, including balance, body position, pain, and temperature. Psychophysics was introduced, discussing thresholds for detecting stimuli and how subliminal messaging works. Signal Detection Theory explained how people discern signals amid noise, highlighting sensitivity and bias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence theories provide frameworks for understanding cognitive abilities across different dimensions. Scientific theories are supported by empirical evidence, are falsifiable, and have predictive power. Proximal explanations address immediate causes, while distal ones offer long-term reasoning. Psychometric theories of intelligence summarize cognitive performance variations using a small number of dimensions, such as reasoning, verbal skills, and visuospatial abilities. Factor analysis helps identify underlying variables, like Spearman’s “g” factor, which represents general intelligence. Correlations between test scores reveal these factors, with mental processing speed and working memory often linked to intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 3: Basics of Inferential Statistics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/statistics/lecture-3/stat-post-lecture-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inferential statistics allow researchers to make general conclusions based on sample data, extending their findings beyond the participants in a study. Key concepts include scores, outliers, and measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode). Variability is measured using variance and standard deviation, which reflect how spread out the scores are from the mean. A normal distribution follows a bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric and unimodal. The central limit theorem explains that, with enough random influences, a precise normal curve results. Z-scores express how far a particular score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, offering insight into its position within the distribution. The normal curve allows us to predict the percentage of scores falling above or below any point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perception is the process by which the brain organizes and interprets sensory signals, enabling us to interact with our environment. It starts with sensation, where physical energy stimulates receptor cells, but perception involves interpreting these signals to understand shapes, objects, and events. Perception is influenced by both bottom-up processing, which begins with stimuli received by sensory organs, and top-down processing, shaped by prior knowledge and expectations. Challenges in perception arise due to the ambiguous nature of stimuli. Objects may be hidden, blurred, or viewed from different angles, making perception complex. Humans use unconscious inference, as proposed by Helmholtz, to perceive the most likely scenario based on sensory input. Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, and good continuation help organize visual information into coherent forms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brain consists of around 86 billion neurons, each forming thousands of connections, enabling rapid transmission of electrical signals. Neurons, the brain’s fundamental units, receive and send information through a complex network. Early theories proposed continuous neural networks, but later discoveries by Golgi and Cajal revealed that neurons are discrete units. The neuron comprises various parts like dendrites (receiving signals), axons (transmitting signals), and myelin sheaths (accelerating transmission). Neural communication occurs via electrochemical processes, following the “all-or-none” principle. When a neuron reaches a specific threshold, it triggers an action potential, sending signals down the axon. The synapse bridges neurons, with neurotransmitters carrying signals across the synaptic cleft to receptor sites. Neurotransmitters regulate various functions, influencing mood, memory, and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covers the concept of measuring intelligence, differentiating between physical, biological, and psychological dimensions. It outlines key scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, explaining their use in categorizing data, ranking, and performing statistical analysis. Various definitions of intelligence by figures like Spearman, Binet, and Wechsler emphasize reasoning, adaptation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological tests, like intelligence, aptitude, and personality tests, are standardized to assess behavior. Intelligence tests sample abilities such as verbal comprehension and visuospatial reasoning, with a positive correlation across tasks (positive manifold). Spearman’s principle highlights that all cognitive tests measure intelligence to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered the concepts of central tendency and variability, essential tools in descriptive statistics. Central tendency refers to finding a single value that represents a set of scores. The three primary measures are the mean, mode, and median. The mean is the arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers, while the median is a more robust measure, representing the middle score when data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent score in a distribution and is typically used for nominal data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. Neurons come in various types, including sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit signals from sensory organs to the brain, while motor neurons control movement. Interneurons facilitate communication between other neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the body’s organs and limbs to the CNS. The PNS is divided into the autonomic nervous system (ANS), controlling involuntary functions like digestion, and the sensory-somatic nervous system (SSNS), which manages voluntary movements and sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lecture covered foundational concepts in statistics, focusing on measurement, data, distributions, tables, and graphs. It began by emphasizing the importance of statistics for conducting research, understanding scientific literature, and developing critical thinking. The field of statistics was divided into two main areas: descriptive statistics, which involves summarizing and organizing data, and inferential statistics, which focuses on drawing conclusions from sample data to generalize about populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Key definitions were introduced, such as data, variables, and different levels of measurement. Variables were classified as either discrete or continuous, and the types of data—qualitative and quantitative—were explained. The levels of measurement were outlined, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, each providing different levels of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes and how the mind operates. It studies how the brain processes information, creates representations of the world, and helps us interact with it to achieve our goals. Cognitive psychology investigates processes like perception, memory, attention, language, reasoning, and decision-making. The brain is central to this, with its 86 billion neurons forming intricate connections. Cognitive processes are examined at three levels: the brain (physical structures and neural activity), the person (mental functions), and the group (social and cultural influences).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LECTURE 1: Psychology as Science</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/introduction-to-psychology/lecture-1/itp-post-lecture-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;lecture-summary&#34;&gt;Lecture summary:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. It systematically examines how the brain operates, its structure, and how it influences observable actions. To understand behavior, psychologists analyze three levels: the brain, the individual, and group dynamics. Psychological inquiry often contrasts scientific methods with intuition. Science relies on empirical data and systematic experimentation, while intuition involves more automatic and emotional thinking. Psychologists prefer empirical methods to ensure objectivity and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that some of you are still sending your homework assignments through email for the Statistics course, despite my multiple reminders and instructions. Please remember that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u class=&#34;text-underline&#34;&gt;all homework must be submitted via Microsoft Forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The links to the assignment forms are available on my blog in each of the lecture posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won’t be accepting any assignments sent by email, so make sure to use the correct submission method. For this, you need a working university-issued &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u class=&#34;text-underline&#34;&gt;@ibu.edu.mk email address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This ensures that your work is properly tracked and graded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Students,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my IBU Blog. We are about to begin a new 2024/2025 academic year at the International Balkan University. I created this blog to facilitate our communication and to reduce the number of emails. This should help us prevent misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When many individuals attempt to communicate via email, it can become confusing and slow. This happens because a single email account can become overloaded, making it difficult to keep track of all the messages. Teachers are also occupied with other responsibilities and may not always be able to respond promptly. That&amp;rsquo;s why I chose to consolidate all my updates in one place online—this blog—for everyone to access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
