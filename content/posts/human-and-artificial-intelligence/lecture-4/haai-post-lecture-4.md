#### Lecture summary:

The lecture focused on alternative models of intelligence beyond the traditional “g-factor.” This general intelligence factor, suggested by Charles Spearman, proposes that cognitive abilities correlate with one another, indicating a common underlying intelligence. However, theories like Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences argue for distinct, independent intelligences such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, and spatial, though critics challenge its lack of empirical support and practical application.

Emotional Intelligence (EI), popularized by Salovey, Mayer, and later Goleman, involves the capacity to perceive, use, and regulate emotions. EI is linked to various life domains, from social relationships to health. Tests like the MSCEIT assess EI based on the four-branch model.

Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory posits three intelligence types: analytic, creative, and practical. Practical intelligence, akin to “street smarts,” highlights adaptability but faces critique for lacking clear distinction from general intelligence. Social Intelligence, originating with Thorndike, emphasizes interpersonal understanding, though valid testing methods remain elusive. Collective Intelligence reflects a group’s ability to problem-solve collectively, often surpassing individual performance, while Leadership and Cultural Intelligences stress the importance of cognitive, social, and emotional skills in diverse, globalized contexts. Each theory offers unique insights into human intelligence, revealing its complex and multi-dimensional nature.
