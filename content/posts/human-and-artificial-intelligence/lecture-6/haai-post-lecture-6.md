#### Lecture summary:

The lecture explored the biological and genetic factors influencing intelligence, focusing on the brain's role in cognitive abilities. Larger brain sizes, both across species and within humans, correlate with higher intelligence. Modern neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI, have established robust connections between brain size and IQ, emphasizing the significance of gray and white matter in problem-solving and information processing.

Intelligence is not localized to a single brain region but arises from distributed functions across areas like the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT) identifies key processes, such as sensory integration, abstraction, and response evaluation, involving specific regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. Efficient connectivity among these areas enhances cognitive performance.

Genetics significantly influence intelligence, with heritability estimates ranging from 40% to 80%. These effects are probabilistic and interact with environmental and individual developmental factors. Variants in numerous genes affect neural development, connectivity, and efficiency, shaping cognitive abilities. Techniques like fMRI and DTI have linked stronger and more efficient brain connectivity to higher IQs, highlighting the role of both structural and functional networks. Overall, intelligence is a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, neural networks, and environmental influences, emphasizing the integrated nature of biological and genetic factors in shaping cognitive capacities.
