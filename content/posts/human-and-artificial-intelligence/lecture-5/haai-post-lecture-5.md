#### Lecture summary:

The lecture explored intelligence development, highlighting factors shaping human intelligence. In infancy, intelligence manifests through early learning, such as visual preferences, sound recognition, and novelty response. Research methods in infant intelligence, including observation and brain imaging, help understand cognitive progress and sensitivity to environmental factors.

The concept of sensitive periods was discussed, emphasizing key phases when environmental inputs, like social interactions or sensory experiences, significantly shape cognitive abilities. Physical aspects such as prenatal health, nutrition, and exposure to pollutants were outlined for their impact on brain development and cognitive functions. Social influences on intelligence, including socioeconomic status and parental education, further underscore environmental impact. Early childhood programs and quality education improve cognitive abilities and lay foundations for future learning. Overall, intelligence emerges through a dynamic interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with both early interventions and sustained educational opportunities playing essential roles in fostering cognitive development.
