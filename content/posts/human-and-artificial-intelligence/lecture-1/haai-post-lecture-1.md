#### Lecture summary:

The lecture introduced the concept of intelligence by highlighting its complexity and various aspects. Intelligence can be both general and specific, and it involves adaptability, learning, problem-solving, reasoning, memory, perception, language comprehension, and emotional intelligence. Definitions of intelligence vary, but it generally refers to the ability to solve problems and understand complex material. Intelligence is often measured through IQ tests, which assess multiple abilities, but these tests do not fully capture cognitive capacity. Several metaphors help explain intelligence, including the geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, sociological, and anthropological models. These metaphors offer different perspectives, such as viewing intelligence as a cultural invention or a cognitive map of the brain. The systems metaphor attempts to combine aspects from multiple models.

Influences on intelligence include genetic and environmental factors. Concepts like “reaction range” suggest that while genetics set a possible range for intelligence, the environment determines where within that range a person functions. Sternberg’s challenge hypothesis identifies three ways to respond to cognitive challenges: adapting, selecting, and shaping the environment. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is a key tool for measuring intelligence, focusing on verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Intelligence is influenced by both genes and environment, with heritability accounting for about half of the variation in IQ. Emotional intelligence also plays a significant role, involving the ability to manage emotions effectively. Finally, the lecture touched on conditions like mental retardation, Down syndrome, and the link between creativity and intelligence.
