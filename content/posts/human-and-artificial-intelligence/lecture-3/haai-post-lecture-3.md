#### Lecture summary:

Intelligence theories provide frameworks for understanding cognitive abilities across different dimensions. Scientific theories are supported by empirical evidence, are falsifiable, and have predictive power. Proximal explanations address immediate causes, while distal ones offer long-term reasoning. Psychometric theories of intelligence summarize cognitive performance variations using a small number of dimensions, such as reasoning, verbal skills, and visuospatial abilities. Factor analysis helps identify underlying variables, like Spearman’s “g” factor, which represents general intelligence. Correlations between test scores reveal these factors, with mental processing speed and working memory often linked to intelligence.

Cognitive models complement psychometric models by exploring the underlying thought processes, such as attention, perception, memory, and decision-making. Processing speed and working memory are crucial for problem-solving and handling multiple tasks. Verbal comprehension and visuospatial ability are also correlated with intelligence, as they measure different cognitive aspects. The process overlap theory integrates psychometric, cognitive, and biological models, suggesting that these frameworks overlap in explaining how intelligence arises from various cognitive processes.
