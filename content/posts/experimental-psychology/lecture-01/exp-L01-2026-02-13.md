## Lecture Summary:

We often rely on intuitive sayings to explain human behavior. Phrases like “birds of a feather flock together” and “opposites attract” both seem plausible—yet they contradict each other. This tension captures a central problem in psychology: commonsense explanations can justify almost any outcome after the fact, but they rarely allow us to predict behavior in advance.

Science emerges as a response to these limitations. Unlike intuition, scientific methodology is systematic and structured. Commonsense reasoning is vulnerable to confirmation bias (seeking only evidence that supports our beliefs), authority bias (accepting claims from high-status individuals without proof), and overconfidence. Errors such as the gambler’s fallacy—believing that independent events influence one another—demonstrate how easily human judgment deviates from probability and logic. Scientific thinking is designed to guard against these cognitive traps.

At its core, the scientific mentality rests on determinism: the assumption that behavior follows lawful patterns rather than randomness. If behavior were entirely chaotic, it could not be studied. Science assumes that causes can be discovered through careful observation and testing. This shift required psychology to distance itself from pseudoscience—fields that imitate scientific language but rely on anecdote and resist disconfirmation. Historical examples such as phrenology and mesmerism illustrate how persuasive ideas can lack empirical grounding. The emergence of experimental psychology, marked by Wilhelm Wundt’s laboratory in 1879, formalized the transition toward measurement, controlled observation, and experimentation.

Modern science is built on empiricism and structured knowledge. Researchers gather observable data, develop theories to organize findings, and derive hypotheses that generate testable predictions. Theories evolve as evidence accumulates, reflecting science’s self-correcting nature. Good scientific thinking is systematic, logical, and open-minded. It values parsimony—the simplest adequate explanation—and depends on public scrutiny through conferences and peer-reviewed journals. In psychology, science is not merely a body of knowledge but an ongoing process of disciplined inquiry.
