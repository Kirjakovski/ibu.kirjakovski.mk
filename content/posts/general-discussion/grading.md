**3. Penalty session**

Penalty session exam consists of 100% of the grade and covers the whole material. The penalty 
session exam period is announced in the academic calendar.

Students who have previously registered for the course, and have failed, have a right to register 
the course for the penalty session.

A student can register maximum 6 courses in penalty session through the Hello System. 

If a student has not previously registered for a course, the student will not be allowed to register 
that course in the penalty session exam.

**Clarification on calculation of Credit Points:**

*Midterm exam*

If the midterm exam consists of 100 points, these are translated in the following way: 
> - 1 point in exam= 1pt x 0.4 = 0.4CP 
> - 50 points in exam= 50pt x 0.4 = 20 CP 
> - 100 points in the exam= 100pt x 0.4= 40 CP 

*Final  exam*

If the Final exam consists of 100 points, these are translated in the following way: 
> - 1 point in exam= 1pt x 0.4 = 0.4CP 
> - 50 points in exam= 50pt x 0.4 = 20 CP 
> - 100 points in the exam= 100pt x 0.4= 40 CP 
 
*Activity*

The activity points are translated in the following way: 
> - 1 point= 1pt x 0.2 = 0.2CP 
> - 50 points = 50pt x 0.2 = 10 CP 
> - 100 points = 100pt x 0.2= 20 CP

*Make up exam*

> - 1 point in exam= 1pt x 0.8 = 0.8 CP 
> - 50 points in exam= 50 pt x 0.8 = 40 CP 
> - 100 points in exam= 100pt x 0.8= 80 CP 

*Activity*

The activity points are translated in the following way: 
> - 1 point = 1pt x 0.2 = 0.2CP 
> - 50 points = 50pt x 0.2 = 10 CP 
> - 100 points = 100pt x 0.2= 20 CP
