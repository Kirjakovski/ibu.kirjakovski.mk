Hello Students,

Welcome to my IBU Blog. We are about to begin a new 2024/2025 academic year at the International Balkan University. I created this blog to facilitate our communication and to reduce the number of emails. This should help us prevent misunderstandings.

When many individuals attempt to communicate via email, it can become confusing and slow. This happens because a single email account can become overloaded, making it difficult to keep track of all the messages. Teachers are also occupied with other responsibilities and may not always be able to respond promptly. That's why I chose to consolidate all my updates in one place online—this blog—for everyone to access.

I hope this blog simplifies things and assists us in achieving even greater success in our studies together.

Asst. Prof. Atanas Kirjakovski
