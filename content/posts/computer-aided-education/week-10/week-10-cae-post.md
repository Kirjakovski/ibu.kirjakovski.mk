## Lecture summary:

Online learning materials encompass diverse formats. Designers must ensure cross-browser compatibility and consider varying user access speeds and preferences for on-screen or printed content. The choice of delivery platform—internet, intranet, or standalone—profoundly affects administration, update processes, accessibility, content possibilities, and speed. Internet sites allow easy updates and wide access but can be constrained by bandwidth for multimedia, potentially slowing navigation. Standalone applications support rich multimedia and fast interaction but involve higher costs and complexity for version control. Intranets often provide a balanced approach.

Effective navigation hinges on clear website structures, frequently using familiar metaphors like a book to enhance predictability. Hyperlinks are vital for non-linear learning paths but require purposeful design to prevent user disorientation. For lengthy pages, internal anchors and 'Top of Page' links aid usability. Minimizing confusion involves limiting page length, using clear headings, maintaining consistent layouts, and providing navigation tools such as menus, frames, and standard icons.

A key concern is users becoming 'lost in hyperspace.' This is mitigated through straightforward, consistent structures, judicious link placement, readily available navigation aids (e.g., home, site map, index), effective design metaphors, and page numbering.

Finally, integrating communication technologies is crucial for robust student-tutor interaction and support. Asynchronous tools like email and forums, complemented by synchronous options such as chat and video conferencing, help reduce learner isolation. These technologies also enable vicarious learning, where students benefit from observing interactions among peers and tutors, thereby enriching the distance education experience, though fostering active participation often requires more than just providing access.
