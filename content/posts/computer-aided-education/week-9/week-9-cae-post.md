## Lecture summary:

Multimedia in computer-aided education engages multiple senses—sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell—to enhance learning effectiveness. Defined as a combination of at least three elements such as video, sound, graphics, text, animation, and photographs, multimedia enriches educational experiences. 

Hypermedia extends this concept by enabling navigation through linked multimedia elements, supporting clear learning goals while requiring careful design to avoid learner confusion. Video is pervasive and motivating but demands interactive use and careful consideration due to high production costs and technical constraints; it excels in demonstrating actions, interactions, and processes. Still images, though less costly and easier to produce, have limited capacity to show motion but can effectively illustrate detailed content and support engagement when combined with narration.

Sound adds atmosphere, attention, feedback, and personalization but risks annoyance if overused; giving learners control over sound settings is essential. Speech supplements information and explanations but should encourage active participation rather than passive listening, with high-quality prerecorded messages preferred. Both speech and sound are more effective when reinforcing other media forms.

Dynamic displays allow interactive manipulation of content on screens but must avoid overwhelming learners. Animation serves as a motivational and illustrative tool if aligned with learning objectives, kept brief, integrated with other media, and controlled by learners.

Choosing media involves balancing strengths and weaknesses: text offers structure and detail but suffers from on-screen readability; video provides realism but is costly; sound establishes mood but can irritate; animation motivates but is expensive; graphics clarify and aid recall; color captures attention but can distract; photographs add realism at low cost.

Inclusivity requires design that accommodates disabled learners using assistive technologies, with text equivalents critical for accessibility. Adhering to accessibility standards broadens material reach, ensuring education benefits all users.
