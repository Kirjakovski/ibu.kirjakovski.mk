## Lecture summary:

The lecture focused on various types of computer-based learning materials. It highlighted the diversity of these materials, which depend on the design strategy, medium, and delivery approach. Key types include computer-based training (CBT), computer-managed learning (CML), integrated learning systems (ILS), intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), electronic performance support systems (EPSS), and computer-aided assessment (CAA).

CBT is characterized by a tutorial approach, presenting content through frames of text and graphics, with learner responses guiding the progression. CML involves managing learning activities, assessments, and administration, with different perspectives for tutors, students, administrators, and technicians. ILS combines extensive learning materials with a management system to tailor content to individual learners' abilities.

ITS integrates expert knowledge into learning materials, adapting to learners' needs through a sophisticated system. EPSS provides job aids and context-sensitive help for specific tasks. CAA typically uses multiple-choice questions for self-assessment and progress tracking.

The lecture also covered drill and practice programs, which offer tutorials followed by practice opportunities. Virtual reality creates immersive environments for exploration, while multimedia incorporates graphics, video, text, and sound to enhance learning. Hypermedia links electronic documents, allowing learners to navigate through related information.

Online learning facilitates downloading packages, accessing hypermedia tutorials, and enhancing communication among learners and tutors. It also enables participation in virtual seminars and conferences globally. The lecture concluded with a discussion on using computers to teach practical task through various computer-based learning methods.
