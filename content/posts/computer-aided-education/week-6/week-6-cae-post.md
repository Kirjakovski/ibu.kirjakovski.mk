## Lecture summary:

The lecture emphasizes the significance of text in computer-based learning, despite the rise of multimedia. Text remains a powerful communication tool, though presenting it on screens differs from traditional print due to lower resolution and landscape orientation. Reading on screens is slower and less comfortable than on paper, necessitating careful design of digital text.

Effective computer-based learning materials should include clear headings, subheadings, and navigation clues, guiding learners through the content. Instructions should outline learning objectives and provide study guidance. An informal, friendly communication style is recommended, using plain language and avoiding jargon.

Text should be presented in manageable chunks, each conveying a single idea, and linked to related content. Scrolling is generally disliked, so text should fit on a single display when possible. Justification styles affect readability, with left and double justification preferred for body text, while centered text suits titles.

Text styles, such as font changes and emphasis techniques like bold or italics, enhance readability and highlight important information. Newspaper techniques, like using white space and narrow columns, improve text navigation. Relevant illustrations aid comprehension and retention, while structured text, like the periodic table, requires clear explanations to be effective.

Color enhances motivation and perceived quality, but must be used carefully to ensure contrast and cultural appropriateness. Highlighting techniques, including size changes and color, draw attention to key information. Summaries and reviews reinforce learning by revisiting key points in varied, engaging formats.
