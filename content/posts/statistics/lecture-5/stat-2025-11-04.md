#### Summary:

This lecture provides a review of Z-scores and the foundational five-step hypothesis-testing process. It then transitions from testing a single individual to testing a sample with multiple individuals ($N>1$). This shift requires a new comparison distribution: the **distribution of means**, also known as the sampling distribution of the mean.

The lecture details the three key characteristics of this distribution, which are defined by the **Central Limit Theorem**.
1.  **Mean:** The mean of the distribution of means ($\mu_M$) is identical to the mean of the population of individuals ($\mu$).
2.  **Variance:** The distribution is less spread out. Its variance ($\sigma_M^2$) is the population variance ($\sigma^2$) divided by the sample size ($N$). Its standard deviation, $\sigma_M = \sigma / \sqrt{N}$, is called the **standard error of the mean (SEM)**.
3.  **Shape:** The distribution of means will be approximately normal if the population is normal, or if the sample size is 30 or more, regardless of the original population's shape.

This framework allows for the **Z-test**, a procedure used when the population variance is known. The formula adapts the Z-score to compare a sample mean ($M$) to the population mean: $Z = (M - \mu_M) / \sigma_M$.

The lecture also introduces **confidence intervals** as a method for estimating a range that likely contains the true population mean. Finally, it defines the two types of **decision errors**: Type I error ($\alpha$), which is rejecting a true null hypothesis, and Type II error ($\beta$), which is failing to reject a false null hypothesis.
