Hi everyone,

I’ve noticed that some of you are still sending your homework assignments through email for the Statistics course, despite my multiple reminders and instructions. Please remember that **{{< underline "all homework must be submitted via Microsoft Forms" >}}**. The links to the assignment forms are available on my blog in each of the lecture posts.

I won’t be accepting any assignments sent by email, so make sure to use the correct submission method. For this, you need a working university-issued **{{< underline "@ibu.edu.mk email address" >}}**. This ensures that your work is properly tracked and graded.

Thanks for your cooperation!
