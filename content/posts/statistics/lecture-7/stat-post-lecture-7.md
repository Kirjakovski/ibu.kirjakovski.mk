#### Lecture summary:

The lecture covered the use of the t-test in hypothesis testing, focusing on its application when the population variance is unknown. The t-test compares sample means to a population mean or between groups. The session highlighted three types of t-tests: single sample, dependent means, and independent means. 

A t-test for a single sample compares a sample mean to a known population mean using an estimated population variance. A dependent means t-test examines differences within the same group by comparing scores across conditions or time points, using difference scores and assuming a mean difference of zero under the null hypothesis. Lastly, the independent means t-test compares means from two separate groups, relying on pooled variance estimates and assuming equal population variances.

Key statistical concepts were reviewed, including degrees of freedom, unbiased estimates, and the robustness of hypothesis-testing procedures against assumption violations. Examples demonstrated the calculations involved, from estimating variances and constructing distributions to calculating the t-score. These examples provided practical insight into designing and interpreting t-tests in varied research scenarios.
