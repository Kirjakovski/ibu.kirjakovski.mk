#### Summary:

Descriptive statistics provide a way to quantify and describe the basic characteristics of a data set. A fundamental aspect of this is identifying a single, representative value that best summarises the entire group of scores. This concept is known as central tendency, and it is measured in three primary ways: the mean, the median, and the mode.

The mean represents the arithmetic average of all scores, calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the total number of scores. It acts as the mathematical balance point of the distribution but can be significantly influenced by extreme scores, or outliers. The mode is simply the most frequently occurring value in a data set. It is particularly useful for describing nominal variables. The median is the middle value when all scores are arranged in ascending order. Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by outliers, making it a more robust measure of central tendency for distributions that are skewed or contain extreme values. In a perfectly symmetrical, unimodal distribution, the mean, median, and mode will all be the same.

Beyond understanding the center of a distribution, it is crucial to measure its variability—the degree to which scores are spread out or clustered together. Two key measures of variability are the variance and the standard deviation. The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences of each score from the mean. While a precise measure, its units are squared, making interpretation less direct. To resolve this, the standard deviation is used. It is the square root of the variance, providing a more intuitive measure that approximates the average distance of any given score from the mean. Together, measures of central tendency and variability offer a foundational summary of a data distribution's key properties.
