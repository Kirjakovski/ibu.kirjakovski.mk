#### Lecture summary:

The lecture covered the concepts of central tendency and variability, essential tools in descriptive statistics. Central tendency refers to finding a single value that represents a set of scores. The three primary measures are the mean, mode, and median. The mean is the arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers, while the median is a more robust measure, representing the middle score when data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent score in a distribution and is typically used for nominal data.

Variability measures how spread out scores are in a data set. Two key metrics are variance and standard deviation. Variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, though it is rarely used directly. Standard deviation, the square root of the variance, is more commonly reported because it is in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret. In comparing central tendency and variability, it’s noted that different distributions can have the same mean but different spreads, influencing the choice of statistical measures based on the dataset’s characteristics.
