#### Lecture summary:

Inferential statistics allow researchers to make general conclusions based on sample data, extending their findings beyond the participants in a study. Key concepts include scores, outliers, and measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode). Variability is measured using variance and standard deviation, which reflect how spread out the scores are from the mean. A normal distribution follows a bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric and unimodal. The central limit theorem explains that, with enough random influences, a precise normal curve results. Z-scores express how far a particular score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, offering insight into its position within the distribution. The normal curve allows us to predict the percentage of scores falling above or below any point.

Population refers to the entire group of interest, while a sample is a smaller, representative subset. Researchers use sample statistics to estimate population parameters, though the latter are often unknown. Random selection ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being part of the sample. Probability in statistics refers to the likelihood of a specific outcome, which can be calculated for events such as coin flips or dice rolls. This concept is crucial for understanding the expected frequency of events in inferential statistics.
