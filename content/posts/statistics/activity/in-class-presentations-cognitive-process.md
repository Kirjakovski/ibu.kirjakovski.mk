### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Choose an Article

Go to Google Scholar. Find a full-text peer-reviewed, empirical research article (one that collects actual data, not a literature review or meta-analysis) on a topic that interests you. Tip: Don’t pick a 50-page paper with six different experiments. Pick a standard paper with a clear, singular focus.

#### Step 2: The  Structure

You only have 3 minutes. That means you cannot read the abstract to us. You must extract the core narrative. Structure your talk using these five specific pillars:

1. The Research Question

- Don't start with "This paper is about memory." Start with the specific gap in knowledge.
- What specific problem were the authors trying to solve?
- Why does this matter?

2. The Hypothesis

- Be precise. What did they expect to happen? Example: "The authors predicted that sleep-deprived participants would perform significantly worse on the visual recall task than the control group."

3. The Method

- Participants: Who were they? (e.g., "100 undergraduates" or "50 clinical patients").
- Procedure: What did they actually do? (e.g., "They watched a scary movie and then filled out a questionnaire.")
- Metric: What is the metric of measurement? (e.g., reaction time, questionnaire scores, error rates, brain activity, etc.)

4. The Conclusion

- The Finding: Was the hypothesis supported? (Yes/No).
- The Interpretation: What does this mean for the real world?
- The Critique: (Optional) Did you notice a major flaw?

#### Step 3: The Rules of Engagement

- No Slides, No Notes: This is a verbal exercise.
- Time Limit: You will be cut off at exactly the 3-minute mark.
