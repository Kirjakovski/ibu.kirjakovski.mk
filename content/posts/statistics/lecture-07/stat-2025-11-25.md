#### Summary:

Real-world psychological research rarely offers access to the true population variance, making the standard Z test impractical for most experimental studies. To overcome this limitation, the t test (or "Student's t") serves as the standard hypothesis-testing procedure when the population variance is unknown and must be estimated directly from sample data. Because the variance of a sample naturally tends to be smaller than the variance of the population from which it is drawn, it is considered a biased estimate. To correct for this bias, the calculation for the estimated population variance ($S^2$) utilizes degrees of freedom ($df=N−1$) in the denominator rather than the total sample size ($N$), ensuring an unbiased estimate.

Unlike the standard normal distribution used in Z tests, the comparison distribution for these statistics is a t distribution. While generally bell-shaped, symmetrical, and unimodal, the t distribution possesses heavier tails, indicating that extreme means are slightly more probable than in a normal curve. The exact shape of this distribution is determined by the degrees of freedom; with small sample sizes, the tails are thick and the cutoffs for significance are more extreme, but as the sample size increases, the distribution becomes nearly identical to the normal curve.

The lecture distinguishes between specific applications of this statistical logic. The t test for a single sample compares a sample mean to a known population mean using the estimated variance. Alternatively, the t test for dependent means (also known as repeated measures or within-subjects design) is utilized when each participant provides two scores, such as in before-and-after designs. This procedure simplifies the analysis by converting the two sets of scores into a single set of difference scores, testing the hypothesis against a comparison distribution with a mean of zero. Finally, the t test for independent means is applicable when comparing scores from two entirely separate groups of people. Researchers must also consider statistical power and effect sizes, using standard tables to determine the necessary sample sizes to detect significant effects
