#### Summary:

This lecture builds upon the fundamentals of hypothesis testing to explore the critical concepts of decision errors, effect size, and statistical power. While standard hypothesis testing determines whether a sample outcome is unlikely under the null hypothesis, this binary decision-making process is prone to error. A Type I error (α) involves rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true—essentially a false positive. A Type II error (β) occurs when one fails to reject a false null hypothesis, resulting in a false negative.

To understand the magnitude of an experimental result beyond its statistical probability, researchers utilize effect size. This standardized measure, often calculated as Cohen’s d, quantifies the difference between population means in terms of standard deviations. Unlike statistical significance, effect size is independent of sample size, making it vital for assessing clinical relevance, conducting meta-analyses, and performing power analyses.

Statistical power (1−β) is defined as the probability that a study will yield a significant result if the research hypothesis is indeed true. It is the complement of a Type II error. A study’s power is determined by several interacting factors: the predicted effect size, the sample size, the chosen significance level (α), the directionality of the test (one-tailed vs. two-tailed), and the population standard deviation. Specifically, larger effect sizes, larger sample sizes, more lenient significance levels, and one-tailed tests all serve to increase statistical power.

Understanding the interplay between these factors is crucial for interpreting research findings. For instance, a statistically significant result in a small sample implies a large, important effect. However, in a very large sample, even a trivial effect may reach statistical significance. Conversely, failing to find significance in a small sample is often inconclusive due to low power, whereas the same result in a large sample suggests the research hypothesis is likely false.
