#### Lecture summary:

Decision errors, effect size, and statistical power are key concepts in hypothesis testing. Decision errors include Type I errors, where the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected (false positive), and Type II errors, where it is wrongly retained (false negative). The probability of a Type I error aligns with the significance level (α), while the probability of a Type II error is denoted by beta (β). Statistical power, calculated as , is the likelihood of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the research hypothesis is true.

Effect size quantifies the difference between populations, indicating the extent of the effect beyond statistical significance. It’s crucial for distinguishing between statistical and clinical significance, aids in meta-analysis, and guides power analysis for adequate sample size. Cohen’s d is a common metric, categorizing effect sizes as small, medium, or large.

Power depends on effect size, sample size, significance level, test directionality, and hypothesis-testing method. Larger effect sizes, lower population variance, higher sample sizes, and one-tailed tests enhance power. Planning for high power typically involves choosing a desired power level, specifying effect size, determining tail direction, and setting α.
