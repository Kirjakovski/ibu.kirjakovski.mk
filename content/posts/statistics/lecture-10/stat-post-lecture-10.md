#### Lecture summary:

The lecture on Chi-Square Tests covered statistical methods for analyzing nominal (categorical) data. Two primary tests were discussed:

Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit: This test evaluates whether the observed frequency distribution of a single nominal variable matches an expected distribution. An example involved the gender representation on cereal boxes, where the observed and expected distributions were compared to determine if discrepancies were due to chance.

Chi-Square Test for Independence: This test assesses whether two nominal variables are independent. A case study analyzed whether the age distribution of male and female characters on cereal boxes was related, using a contingency table and calculated expected frequencies.

Key terms explained included observed frequency, expected frequency, degrees of freedom, and the chi-square statistic. The assumptions for these tests were minimal, focusing on the independence of observations. Effect size measures, such as the phi coefficient and Cramer’s V, were introduced for interpreting the strength of relationships in chi-square analyses.
