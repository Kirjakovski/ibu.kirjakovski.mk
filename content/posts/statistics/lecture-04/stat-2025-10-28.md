#### Summary:

This lecture introduces hypothesis testing, the formal procedure used to decide if the results from a sample study support a theory or prediction about a population. This process involves using known sample statistics (like the sample mean, $M$) to make inferences about unknown population parameters (like the population mean, $\mu$). This logic is grounded in the properties of the normal curve, a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution where a Z score indicates a specific score's location and probability.

The testing procedure uses a roundabout, "double-negative" logic. A researcher starts with a research hypothesis ($H_1$), which is the prediction (e.g., a difference exists, $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$). To test this, they set up the opposite, the null hypothesis ($H_0$), which posits no difference (e.g., $\mu_1 = \mu_2$). The core question is: "What is the probability of obtaining our sample result if the null hypothesis were true?"

A five-step process is followed:
1.  State the research and null hypotheses.
2.  Determine the comparison distribution, which represents the population situation if $H_0$ is true.
3.  Set a cutoff sample score (critical value) based on a significance level (e.g., $p < .05$), defining an "unlikely" region.
4.  Calculate the sample's test statistic (e.g., a Z score) on that distribution.
5.  Decide: If the sample's score falls in the unlikely region (is more extreme than the cutoff), the null hypothesis is rejected, and the result is deemed statistically significant. If not, the result is inconclusive.

When testing a single sample mean ($M$) against a population with a known mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$), the Z test is used. The comparison distribution is the distribution of means, which is narrower than the population distribution and has a standard error of $\sigma_M = \sigma/\sqrt{N}$.

The test can be directional (a one-tailed test for $\mu_1 > \mu_2$) or nondirectional (a two-tailed test for $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$). A two-tailed test is more conservative because it splits the significance level (e.g., 2.5% in each tail) and requires a more extreme result to reject the null hypothesis.
