## Lecture summary:

The lecture defined aggression as intentional behaviour aimed at causing physical harm or psychological pain, differentiating between hostile aggression (stemming from anger) and instrumental aggression (a means to an end).

An exploration into aggression's origins questioned whether it is innate, learned, or optional. Evolutionary psychology posits that male physical aggression is genetically programmed for defence and gene perpetuation, while female aggression often serves to protect offspring. Animal studies, like Kuo’s kitten and rat experiment, show experience can modify instinct, though other research suggests some aggression is biologically hardwired. Testosterone is linked to aggression, particularly in males, but its relationship with behaviour is complex and reciprocal.

Culture significantly influences the expression of aggression; while humans are capable of aggression, its manifestation depends on learned norms and circumstances, evident in phenomena like "cultures of honor." Gender differences are observed, with men more prone to physical aggression and women to relational aggression (e.g., social manipulation, cyberbullying), though provocation can reduce these disparities.

The social-cognitive learning theory, famously demonstrated by Bandura’s Bobo Doll experiment, indicates that aggression is learned through observing and imitating others. Physiological factors such as alcohol, pain, and heat can lower the threshold for aggressive responses. Frustration, provocation, and the presence of aggressive cues like weapons (the "weapons effect") are situational triggers. The discussion also covered sexual assault, noting motivations like dominance and the impact of culturally learned sexual scripts.

Exposure to media violence correlates with increased aggressive behaviour, thoughts, and emotions, potentially causing desensitization. Longitudinal studies suggest a link between early media violence consumption and later aggression.

Regarding prevention, punishment can deter aggression if it is immediate, consistent, and proportionate, but harsh punishment may backfire. The catharsis hypothesis—venting anger to reduce it—is largely ineffective. Constructive anger management, empathy training, and improved communication skills are more successful in diminishing aggression, alongside specific interventions like bullying prevention programs.
