## Lecture summary:

The lecture on social cognition explored how individuals perceive and interpret the social world. It highlighted the distinction between automatic and controlled thinking. Automatic thinking is non-conscious, effortless, and involves the use of schemas—mental structures that help organize social information. These schemas are influenced by culture and can be primed by recent experiences, affecting judgments and decisions. The lecture also discussed the self-fulfilling prophecy, where expectations about others can influence their behavior, making those expectations come true.

The session examined various mental shortcuts, known as judgmental heuristics, which simplify decision-making. These include the availability heuristic, where judgments are based on how easily something comes to mind, and the representativeness heuristic, where people classify things based on similarity to a typical case. Cultural differences in thinking styles were noted, with Western cultures favoring analytic thinking and East Asian cultures favoring holistic thinking.

Controlled thinking, which is conscious and effortful, was contrasted with automatic thinking. The lecture questioned the extent of free will, suggesting that conscious thought might be a result of unconscious processes. Counterfactual thinking, or imagining alternative past scenarios, was discussed for its emotional impact.

Social perception, the process of forming impressions and making inferences about others, was explored, emphasizing the role of nonverbal communication. Channels such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice convey emotions and attitudes. The lecture concluded with the attribution theory, explaining how people infer the causes of behavior, and the two-step attribution process, which involves initial internal attributions followed by consideration of situational factors. The importance of improving human thinking by recognizing the overconfidence barrier and enhancing statistical reasoning was also emphasized.
