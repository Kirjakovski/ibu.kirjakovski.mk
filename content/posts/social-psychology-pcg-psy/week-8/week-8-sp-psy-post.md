## Lecture summary:

The lecture on conformity and obedience in social psychology outlined key forms of social influence: persuasion, compliance, conformity, and obedience. Persuasion involves deliberate attempts to change internal attitudes through communication, while compliance refers to behavioral changes in response to explicit or implicit requests without necessarily altering beliefs. Conformity entails adjusting behaviors or attitudes to align with group norms, often driven by the desire for social acceptance, and obedience involves following direct commands from authority figures, emphasizing external behavior changes.

Informational social influence occurs when individuals look to others for guidance in ambiguous or crisis situations, leading to private acceptance or public compliance, as demonstrated in Sherif’s autokinetic experiments and Baron et al.’s eyewitness study. Normative social influence, by contrast, is motivated by the need to be liked and accepted, often resulting in public compliance without private acceptance, as shown in Asch’s line-judgment studies. Neurobiological research reveals distinct brain activity patterns associated with conformity and dissent.

Factors influencing normative conformity include group size, importance, unanimity, and cultural context, with collectivistic cultures exhibiting higher conformity rates. Minority influence can induce change when minorities consistently express unified views, leveraging informational influence. Injunctive norms (perceived approvals) and descriptive norms (perceived behaviors) differently affect actions such as littering, with potential for a “boomerang effect” when descriptive norms inadvertently reinforce undesirable behaviors.

Additional social influence tactics include the foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face techniques, as well as propaganda. Obedience, a powerful form of influence rooted in socialization to legitimate authority, was extensively studied by Milgram, whose experiments revealed high obedience rates that varied with situational factors. Obedience is sustained by conforming to shifting norms, self-justification, and diffusion of responsibility, illustrating how ordinary individuals can commit harmful acts under social pressure.

The lecture concluded with recommendations for key journals publishing social influence research.
