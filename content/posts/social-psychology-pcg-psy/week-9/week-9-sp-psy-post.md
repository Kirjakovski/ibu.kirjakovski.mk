## Lecture summary:

Prejudice refers to a hostile or negative attitude toward people based solely on their group membership, encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. It operates bidirectionally, between majority and minority groups. The cognitive aspect involves categorization—a natural, adaptive process where the mind groups people based on traits—which may lead to stereotyping, defined as generalized beliefs about a group’s members. Stereotypes act as mental shortcuts but often distort reality, highlighting differences between groups while ignoring larger variations within them.

The affective component involves emotions, making prejudices resistant to logical arguments. Behavioral consequences manifest as discrimination—unjust negative actions based on group membership—though not all who hold prejudices act on them due to various moderating factors like social norms.

Hidden prejudices are often suppressed in social contexts. Tools like the Implicit Association Test attempt to reveal unconscious biases, though their accuracy and predictive power are debated. Victims of prejudice frequently experience reduced self-esteem and stereotype threat—a fear of confirming negative stereotypes—which can impair performance. Self-affirmation can help counter these effects.

Prejudice arises from normative social rules and institutional discrimination, as well as psychological processes such as social identity, where in-group bias favors one’s own group, and out-group homogeneity perceives other groups as more uniform. Realistic conflict theory explains prejudice as competition over limited resources, as demonstrated in social experiments.

Reducing prejudice is complex; simply confronting stereotypes with facts can backfire. The Contact Hypothesis proposes that prejudice decreases when groups of equal status work cooperatively toward common goals, supported by social norms. Effective reduction involves interdependence, equal status, friendly interaction, exposure to multiple group members, and community endorsement of equality.
