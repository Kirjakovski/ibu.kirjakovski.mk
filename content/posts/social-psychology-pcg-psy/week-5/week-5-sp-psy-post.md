## Lecture summary:

Attitudes are evaluations of people, objects, and ideas, shaped by genetics and social experiences. They have three components: cognitive (based on beliefs), affective (rooted in emotions and values), and behavioral (inferred from actions). Attitudes can be explicit (consciously endorsed) or implicit (unconscious and shaped by early experiences).

Their influence on behavior depends on accessibility and context. Spontaneous actions align with strong, readily available attitudes, while deliberate behavior follows the Theory of Planned Behavior, which considers specific attitudes, social norms, and perceived control.

Attitudes can change due to social influences and persuasion. The Yale Attitude Change Approach studies how message source, content, and audience affect persuasion. The Elaboration Likelihood Model outlines two routes to attitude change: the central route, which relies on logical argumentation, and the peripheral route, which depends on superficial cues.

Fear-arousing messages can be effective if they provide solutions. Emotion-based appeals work best for affectively driven attitudes, while rational arguments are more effective for cognitively based ones. Physical actions, such as nodding, can also reinforce attitudes.

Resistance to persuasion can be strengthened through attitude inoculation, awareness of product placement, and understanding psychological reactance, which occurs when perceived freedom is threatened.
