## Lecture summary:

A lecture on prosocial behaviour examined why individuals help others. The core of helping behaviour stems from several foundational motivations. Evolutionary psychology suggests that instincts drive helping, primarily through kin selection, favouring genetic relatives to ensure gene propagation. The norm of reciprocity, the expectation of future aid, and the contested idea of group selection, where altruistic groups might out-survive selfish ones, also contribute to this perspective. The Chernobyl disaster provided a stark example of extreme altruism.

Beyond evolutionary drives, social exchange theory presents a pragmatic view, suggesting individuals help when the perceived benefits, such as social approval or relief from distress, outweigh the costs, like danger or time. In contrast, the empathy-altruism hypothesis posits that genuine empathy for another's plight can motivate purely selfless aid, irrespective of personal gain, a concept supported by experimental studies like the "Carol Marcy" scenario.

Individual characteristics and context further shape helping actions. While an "altruistic personality" may predispose some to help, factors like gender influence the *type* of help offered. Cultural norms, such as "simpat√≠a" in Spanish-speaking countries or the tendency to favour in-group members, play a significant role. Even transient moods can affect behaviour; positive feelings often encourage helping, and sometimes negative states like guilt do too.

Situational determinants are powerful. Urban environments, with their constant stimulation, can lead to an "urban overload" effect, reducing help compared to rural settings. Similarly, people with long-term community ties are more prosocial. Crucially, the bystander effect demonstrates that the presence of multiple witnesses can decrease an individual's likelihood of intervening in an emergency. Understanding these influences, including the impact of prosocial media, allows for strategies to increase helping, such as raising awareness of intervention barriers and fostering genuine volunteerism.
