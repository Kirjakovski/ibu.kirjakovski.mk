#### Summary:

Chi-square tests serve as essential hypothesis-testing procedures for nominal data, where variables are categorical rather than quantitative. These tests evaluate frequencies—the number of observations in specific categories—and are divided into two primary types. The chi-square test for goodness of fit analyzes a single nominal variable to determine how well an observed frequency distribution matches an expected pattern. Conversely, the chi-square test for independence examines whether the distribution of one nominal variable relates to another, utilizing contingency tables to organize combinations of categories.

The calculated chi-square statistic reflects the overall lack of fit between observed and expected frequencies. Determining significance involves comparing this statistic to cutoff scores in a chi-square table based on specific degrees of freedom and significance levels. For $2 \times 2$ contingency tables, the measure of association is the phi coefficient, while Cramer’s phi serves as the effect-size measure for larger tables. Statistical power in these tests is influenced by sample size and the complexity of the contingency table.

When data violates the parametric assumptions of normality and equal variance, researchers utilize nonparametric or distribution-free tests. One strategy involves data transformations, such as square-root, log, or inverse procedures, to move non-normal distributions closer to a normal curve. Another approach is the use of rank-order tests, which transform scores into ranks to create a uniform, rectangular distribution. Common rank-order equivalents to parametric procedures include the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for dependent means, the Mann-Whitney U test for independent means, and Spearman’s rho for correlation.

Modern statistical analysis also incorporates computer-intensive methods like randomization and bootstrap tests. Randomization tests consider every possible reorganization of sample data to assess the probability of the actual result occurring by chance. Similarly, bootstrap tests create multiple estimates of a statistic by generating a large number of randomly selected samples from the original data. These methods provide robust alternatives for hypothesis testing when traditional assumptions cannot be met.
