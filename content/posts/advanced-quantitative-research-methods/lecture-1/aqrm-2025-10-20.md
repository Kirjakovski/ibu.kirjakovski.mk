#### Summary:

This lecture introduces quantitative research as an objective, theory-driven approach that quantifies events into numerical data for statistical analysis. It contrasts with qualitative methods, which focus on interpreting social reality. A core component of this process is measurement: the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules. For a measure to be useful, it must be both reliable (consistent) and valid (accurately measuring what it intends to measure). Reliability is a necessary prerequisite for validity.

Research begins with an abstract theoretical construct (e.g., "stress"), which is then given an operational definition to make it measurable. This creates a variable, a characteristic that can have different values. In experiments, the independent variable (IV) is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect on the dependent variable (DV). Variables are classified by their level of measurement: nominal scales are categorical (e.g., ethnicity); ordinal scales represent rank order (e.g., finishing place in a race); interval scales have equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius); and ratio scales have a true zero point (e.g., height, reaction time).

Once data is collected, it is organized into frequency tables and visualized in graphs like histograms. These visualizations reveal the data's frequency distribution, which can be unimodal (one peak) or bimodal (two peaks), symmetrical (like a normal curve) or skewed (piled to one side). Skewness often results from floor effects (scores piling at the low end) or ceiling effects (scores piling at the high end). Finally, quantitative research employs several approaches, including descriptive methods (surveys, case studies), correlational studies (which identify relationships but not causation), and experiments, which manipulate variables to establish cause and effect. This entire process relies on statistics, the branch of mathematics used to organize, analyze (descriptive statistics), and draw conclusions from data (inferential statistics).
