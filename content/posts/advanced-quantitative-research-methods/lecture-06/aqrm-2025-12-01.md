#### Summary:

Statistical procedures for comparing groups focus primarily on the t test family and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The t test serves as a hypothesis-testing method when population variance is unknown, necessitating estimation from sample data. This estimation process involves degrees of freedom, defined as the number of scores free to vary in a sample once the mean is known. Because sample variance typically underestimates population variance, researchers use an unbiased estimate by dividing the sum of squared deviations by $N-1$ instead of $N$.

Three primary variations of the t test accommodate different research designs. The single-sample t test compares a sample mean to a known population mean with an unknown variance. The t test for dependent means, often used in repeated measures or within-subjects designs, analyzes difference scores from the same participants across two points in time. The t test for independent means compares scores from two entirely separate groups, utilizing a pooled estimate of population variance and a distribution of differences between means. All t tests assume population normality and independence of scores, though they exhibit robustness to moderate violations.
