## Lecture for self-study:

**Ethical Issues in Couples and Family Therapy**

The main objective of the chapter is to identify and analyze ethical issues unique to couples and family therapy—specifically regarding systems theory, ethical standards, informed consent, confidentiality, therapist values, gender sensitivity, and therapist responsibilities—and its key contribution is a comprehensive delineation of the complexities in balancing the welfare of individual members with that of the family system, clarifying the necessity for specialized ethical guidelines, informed consent processes, and continual self-awareness to maintain objectivity and avoid imposing personal values on clients.
