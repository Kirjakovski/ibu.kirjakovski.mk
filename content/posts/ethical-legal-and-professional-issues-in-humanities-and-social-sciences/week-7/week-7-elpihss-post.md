## Lecture summary:

Professional competence in the humanities and social sciences is both an ethical and legal duty, rooted in the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. Inadequate competence can result in client harm and legal consequences. Ethical practice demands self-awareness, continuous self-evaluation, and a commitment to lifelong learning.

Professional guidelines from organizations such as ACA, APA, and NASW emphasize practicing within oneâ€™s scope, cultural competence, and the importance of supervision and consultation. However, defining the limits of competence and minimum qualifications remains a challenge.

Competence is cultivated through rigorous education, supervised practice, and personal development. Training programs must evaluate not only academic performance but also emotional and interpersonal readiness. Faculty act as gatekeepers, responsible for identifying and addressing deficiencies or dismissing students when necessary.

Assessment should be both formative and summative, incorporating feedback from peers and faculty. Institutions must establish transparent criteria for evaluation and remediation to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. Dismissals typically stem from inadequate skills, psychological unsuitability, or ethical concerns.

Therapists are ethically obligated to refer clients when issues exceed their competence, ensuring the referral process is transparent and supportive. Licensure and certification set minimum standards but do not guarantee competence; professionals must operate strictly within their areas of expertise.

Continuing education is essential for maintaining competence, with most ethics codes requiring it for license renewal. Ethical training programs must prioritize diversity, cultural sensitivity, and clear communication of expectations.

Faculty must document concerns and provide remediation opportunities before considering dismissal. In the digital era, training must also address the ethical complexities of online and cross-border practice, requiring adaptation of traditional skills. Ultimately, competence is a lifelong commitment, central to ethical, effective, and inclusive professional practice.
