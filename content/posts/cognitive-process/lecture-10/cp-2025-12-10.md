#### Summary:

Human thinking consists of complex cognitive processes including judgment, reasoning, and decision-making. Judgment involves forming evaluations based on observations, while reasoning represents the process of drawing conclusions from evidence. Decision-making serves as the final selection between alternatives, relying heavily on the preceding judgmental and reasoning stages. These processes are inherently interconnected and often rely on dual systems: the fast, intuitive System 1 and the slow, analytical System 2.

Inductive reasoning draws general conclusions from specific observations. The strength of such arguments is determined by the number, quality, and representativeness of the evidence. Because this reasoning is probabilistic rather than definite, humans often employ heuristics, or mental shortcuts. The availability heuristic leads individuals to judge the probability of events based on how easily they can be recalled from memory, often influenced by media salience or emotional charge. The representativeness heuristic causes people to categorize instances based on how well they match a stereotype, frequently leading to base rate neglect or violations of the conjunction rule. Additional cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, the myside bias, and the backfire effect, further complicate inductive judgments by causing individuals to favor information that supports prior beliefs.

Deductive reasoning moves from broad principles to specific conclusions, often structured as categorical or conditional syllogisms. In these logical arguments, validity is distinct from truth; a conclusion is valid if it logically follows from its premises, even if those premises are factually incorrect. Conditional reasoning frequently involves "If… then" statements, where logical errors often occur when individuals incorrectly affirm the consequent or deny the antecedent.

Decision-making is further influenced by emotions and context. Expected utility theory suggests humans make rational, goal-oriented choices, yet behavioral studies demonstrate that framing effects, incidental emotions, and the status quo bias often lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Neuroeconomics identifies that these choices emerge from a continuous interaction between the brain's emotional limbic system and the rational prefrontal cortex.
