#### Summary:

Human language is defined as a system of communication utilizing sounds or symbols to express feelings, thoughts, ideas, and experiences. Its defining characteristic is creativity, which stems from a structure that is both hierarchical and rule-based, allowing for the generation of unique sequences. Psycholinguistics examines the psychological processes behind this ability, breaking language down into phonology (sounds), syntax (structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (implied meaning).

At the lexical level, word frequency heavily influences processing speed, with high-frequency words eliciting faster responses than low-frequency ones. Readers must also navigate lexical ambiguity, where context and meaning dominance help select the correct interpretation of multi-meaning words. When combining words into sentences, the mind engages in parsing. The Garden Path Model suggests this is done via heuristics like late closure, while the constraint-based approach argues that syntax, semantics, and context serve as simultaneous constraints to guide understanding.

Text comprehension extends beyond literal wording through the use of inferences—anaphoric, instrument, and causal—which allow readers to create coherence and bridge gaps in the narrative. This process forms a situation model, a mental representation that simulates the perceptual and motor aspects of the story. In conversational settings, successful communication requires cooperation, specifically through the given-new contract and the establishment of common ground, often leading to syntactic coordination between speakers. Finally, comparative research reveals that music and language share significant neural resources, as both rely on structured sequences and implicit rules to generate expectations.
