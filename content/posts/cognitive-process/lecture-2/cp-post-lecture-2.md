#### Lecture summary:

The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. Neurons come in various types, including sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons transmit signals from sensory organs to the brain, while motor neurons control movement. Interneurons facilitate communication between other neurons. The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the body’s organs and limbs to the CNS. The PNS is divided into the autonomic nervous system (ANS), controlling involuntary functions like digestion, and the sensory-somatic nervous system (SSNS), which manages voluntary movements and sensory information.

The brain is structured into lobes, each responsible for different cognitive functions. The occipital lobes process visual information, temporal lobes manage auditory input and memory, parietal lobes handle touch and spatial awareness, and frontal lobes are involved in planning, reasoning, and emotions. The cerebral cortex, the brain’s outer layer, is key for higher-order mental processes, while subcortical structures like the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala regulate sensory input, memory, and emotions. Neural communication occurs via neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between neurons at synapses. This process is fundamental to all brain functions, including perception, memory, and learning. The brain’s structural and functional connectivity ensures that different regions work together dynamically, supporting complex tasks like language, decision-making, and motor control.
