#### Lecture summary:

Perception is the process by which the brain organizes and interprets sensory signals, enabling us to interact with our environment. It starts with sensation, where physical energy stimulates receptor cells, but perception involves interpreting these signals to understand shapes, objects, and events. Perception is influenced by both bottom-up processing, which begins with stimuli received by sensory organs, and top-down processing, shaped by prior knowledge and expectations. Challenges in perception arise due to the ambiguous nature of stimuli. Objects may be hidden, blurred, or viewed from different angles, making perception complex. Humans use unconscious inference, as proposed by Helmholtz, to perceive the most likely scenario based on sensory input. Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, and good continuation help organize visual information into coherent forms.

Top-down processes help us recognize objects in different contexts and assist in speech segmentation, allowing us to distinguish words in continuous speech. Additionally, perception is shaped by regularities in the environment, such as the assumption that light comes from above. The brain adapts to experiences, with certain neurons becoming specialized in recognizing specific objects or faces. Movement enhances perception by revealing hidden features of objects. The brain has two main processing streams: the “what” pathway for identifying objects and the “where” pathway for locating them. Mirror neurons play a role in understanding actions by simulating observed behavior, linking perception to action.
