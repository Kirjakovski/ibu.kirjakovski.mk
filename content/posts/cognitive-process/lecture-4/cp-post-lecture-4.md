#### Lecture summary:

Attention, a key cognitive process, is essential for selecting and focusing on specific stimuli. William James described attention as the mind’s process of vividly highlighting certain elements while filtering others. Broadbent’s Filter Model emphasized that attention filters input based on physical characteristics, while Treisman modified this to suggest a more flexible approach, allowing some unattended information through if it’s significant, such as one’s name (the “cocktail party effect”). Later models proposed that attention could also occur at a later processing stage, selecting information by meaning. Processing capacity and perceptual load influence attention’s effectiveness; easier tasks allow for more distraction processing, while complex tasks limit this. Load Theory posits that high-load tasks consume all cognitive resources, reducing susceptibility to distractions, as shown in the Stroop Effect and Lavie’s work.

Attention also affects visual processing, with eye movements like saccades focusing on central vision, while peripheral vision gathers broader scene context. Scanning attention is influenced by salient stimuli, cognitive factors, and task demands. Experimentally, attention improves responses, perception, and even affects physiological brain activity, evident in Datta and DeYoe’s “attention maps.” Divided attention, achievable with practice, can lead to automatic processing for familiar tasks, though complex tasks demand focused attention. Distractions, such as from mobile phones, significantly impair tasks like driving. Attention lapses also cause inattentional blindness and change blindness, where individuals fail to notice clear stimuli or scene changes. Lastly, Treisman’s Feature Integration Theory proposes that attention helps combine separate features into coherent object perception. Neuroimaging studies show that attention engages specific brain networks, namely the ventral and dorsal attention networks, highlighting its neural basis and integration in cognitive control.
