Dear students, this is to inform you that the scheduled lecture for Tuesday (17 Dec) on "Human Intelligence" in the course **Cognitive Processes** will not be held as planned due to some other obligation I need to attend to.

To ensure continuity in your learning, please study **"Chapter 13: Human Intelligence"** from the textbook Sternberg, R. J., & Sternberg, K. (2017). *Cognitive psychology* (7th ed.). Cengage Learning. {{< a_blank title="(.pdf)" url="https://ibuit-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kirjakovski_ibu_edu_mk/ERiMyzJ-LotFqEk0Z-J7C8YBtWEfSvELdtfNbQ8B1T6RsA?e=JBOlVH" >}}

This chapter covers essential concepts related to human intelligence, including key theories, research findings, and practical applications. Be sure to take notes and reflect on the material as it will be crucial for upcoming discussions and assessments.

If you have any questions or need clarification on the material, please bring them to our next scheduled class session. We will allocate time to address your concerns and deepen our understanding of the topic.

Thank you for your understanding and commitment to your studies.

Asst. Prof. Atanas Kirjakovski
