#### Summary:

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to learn from experience and adapt to the surrounding environment, integrating various cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and reasoning. Historically, measurement approaches evolved from Francis Galton’s psychophysical methods to Alfred Binet’s judgmental approach, which focused on academic learning and higher-level judgment. This led to the development of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), transitioning from William Stern’s ratio-based formula to the modern deviation IQ, which utilizes a normal distribution bell curve with an average score of 100. Contemporary assessment is primarily conducted through the Stanford-Binet and Wechsler scales, which evaluate domains like fluid reasoning, verbal comprehension, and processing speed.

Structural theories of intelligence include Spearman’s "g" factor, representing a single general ability, and Thurstone’s identification of seven primary mental abilities. Hierarchical models, such as those by Cattell and Carroll, further categorize intelligence into broad strata, including fluid and crystallized abilities. From an information-processing perspective, researchers analyze the speed and accuracy of mental manipulation. This includes process-timing theories related to reaction time and componential theories that break down complex problem-solving into encoding, inference, mapping, and application. Efficient global planning is a hallmark of high intellectual performance.

Alternative frameworks challenge unitary views of intelligence. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences proposes eight independent systems, such as musical, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal abilities. Sternberg’s triarchic theory emphasizes analytical, creative, and practical aspects. Cultural context is also vital, as definitions of intelligent behavior vary across societies, influencing how individuals perform in real-world versus classroom settings. Furthermore, intelligence is malleable; environmental factors, supportive home settings, and a growth mindset can enhance cognitive performance. Finally, the field of artificial intelligence seeks to simulate human cognition or exceed it through brute-force methods, though philosophical arguments like the Chinese Room suggest that machines may follow syntax without genuine semantic understanding.
