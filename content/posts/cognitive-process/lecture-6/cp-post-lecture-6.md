#### Lecture summary:

The lecture on conceptual knowledge covered key aspects of how humans categorize and process information about objects and ideas. Concepts serve as mental representations for individual objects or abstract ideas, while categories group these objects based on shared features. The definitional approach to categorization relies on strict criteria, but the concept of family resemblance, proposed by Wittgenstein, suggests that category members can vary yet still share core similarities. Two major categorization approaches were discussed: the prototype approach, which uses an averaged representation of a category, and the exemplar approach, which considers multiple specific examples. While prototypes streamline category recognition, exemplars maintain detailed information, aiding in handling diverse categories.

Hierarchical organization categorizes from general (global) to specific (subordinate) levels, with the basic level being most psychologically relevant. Semantic networks explain how our brain organizes category-related knowledge, with Collins and Quillian’s model illustrating concepts as connected nodes. The connectionist approach builds on this, modeling category knowledge as distributed networks, resilient to damage. Further, the lecture discussed various theories on brain-based categorization. The sensory-functional hypothesis posits distinct systems for recognizing living and non-living things, though evidence suggests overlap in these categories. The multiple-factor approach investigates properties across categories, while the semantic category approach links certain brain circuits with specific categories. The embodied approach ties knowledge to sensory-motor experiences, supported by “mirror neurons.” Lastly, the hub and spoke model integrates these views, suggesting that the anterior temporal lobe connects category-specific functions across the brain.
