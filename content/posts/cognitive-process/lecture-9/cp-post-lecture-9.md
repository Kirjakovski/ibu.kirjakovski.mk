#### Lecture summary:

The lecture provided an overview of problem-solving and creativity from a cognitive psychology perspective. It discussed the Gestalt approach, which emphasizes how the representation of a problem in one's mind influences the solution. The concept of insight, where a sudden realization leads to a reorganization of the mental representation, was explored. Obstacles to problem-solving, such as functional fixedness and mental set, were also covered.

The information-processing approach, as proposed by Newell and Simon, was introduced. This view sees problem-solving as navigating a problem space, with an initial state, goal state, and possible intermediate states. The importance of how a problem is stated and the use of analogies in problem-solving were highlighted.

The lecture also examined the differences between experts and novices in problem-solving, with experts possessing more organized knowledge and spending more time analyzing problems. The concept of creativity was discussed, emphasizing the importance of both originality and usefulness. Examples of practical creativity, such as the invention of Velcro and the Od√≥n device, were provided. Finally, the lecture touched on the creative problem-solving process and the role of the brain in insight and problem-solving, including the concept of "thinking outside the box."
