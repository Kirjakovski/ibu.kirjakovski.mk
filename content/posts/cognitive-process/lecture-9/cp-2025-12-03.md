#### Summary:

Cognitive psychologists define a problem as a situation where an obstacle exists between a present state and a goal state, necessitating specific actions to bridge the gap. The Gestalt approach emphasizes that success depends heavily on how a problem is represented in the mind, often requiring a process of restructuring or reorganizing that representation. This restructuring facilitates insight, a sudden realization or "Aha!" experience that differs fundamentally from the gradual, step-by-step progress seen in analytical or non-insight problems.

Problem-solving is frequently hindered by fixation, particularly functional fixedness, where individuals focus largely on the familiar functions of an object rather than its potential for novel use. Similarly, a mental set—a preconceived notion based on past success—can prevent solvers from seeing simpler, more effective solutions. In contrast, the information-processing approach views problem-solving as a search within a "problem space," utilizing operators and means-end analysis to navigate from an initial state to a goal state. The framing of a problem also plays a critical role; highlighting specific features, such as the color differences in the Mutilated Checkerboard problem, can significantly facilitate a solution.

Analogical problem solving utilizes solutions from similar "source" problems to address current "target" problems. This process relies on noticing, mapping, and applying connections, though surface features often distract from the deep structural principles necessary for success. This distinction defines expertise; experts organize knowledge based on deep principles and "chunk" information based on experience, whereas novices rely on surface features. Finally, creativity involves divergent thinking and a four-stage process of generation, formulation, solving, and implementation. Neurologically, creative thought is linked to the interaction between the Default Mode Network and the Executive Control Network, and can be enhanced through practices like open monitoring meditation.
