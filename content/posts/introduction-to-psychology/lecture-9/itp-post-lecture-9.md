#### Lecture summary:

Lifespan development explores the changes in physiology, behavior, cognition, and emotions across human life. Development begins at conception, where genetic material combines to form a zygote, progressing through germinal, embryonic, and fetal stages. Key influences include teratogens, maternal health, and environmental factors, with timing and dosage of exposure significantly affecting outcomes.

Physical development proceeds from infancy, marked by rapid growth and motor skill acquisition, through adolescence, where puberty triggers dramatic changes, to late adulthood, where physical decline becomes prominent. Cognitive development, shaped by experiences and neurological maturation, evolves from Piaget's sensorimotor exploration in infancy to postformal reasoning in adulthood.

Language acquisition and moral reasoning progress with age, supported by neural and environmental factors. Kohlbergâ€™s stages describe shifts from rule-based to principled reasoning, though cultural and contextual differences influence these patterns. Erikson's psychosocial stages highlight how identity and relationships evolve, emphasizing secure attachment and its long-term benefits.

Parenting styles significantly impact social and emotional outcomes, with authoritative approaches linked to the best results. In late adulthood, retirement and bereavement bring challenges and opportunities, with social support crucial for well-being. Cultural norms shape grief practices, while interventions can aid adjustment. Lifespan development underscores the interplay of nature, nurture, and individual agency in human growth.
