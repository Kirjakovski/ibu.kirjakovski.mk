#### Lecture summary:

The brain consists of around 86 billion neurons, each forming thousands of connections, enabling rapid transmission of electrical signals. Neurons, the brain’s fundamental units, receive and send information through a complex network. Early theories proposed continuous neural networks, but later discoveries by Golgi and Cajal revealed that neurons are discrete units. The neuron comprises various parts like dendrites (receiving signals), axons (transmitting signals), and myelin sheaths (accelerating transmission). Neural communication occurs via electrochemical processes, following the “all-or-none” principle. When a neuron reaches a specific threshold, it triggers an action potential, sending signals down the axon. The synapse bridges neurons, with neurotransmitters carrying signals across the synaptic cleft to receptor sites. Neurotransmitters regulate various functions, influencing mood, memory, and motor control.

The nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord, responsible for processing information, while the PNS transmits signals between the CNS and the rest of the body. The brain’s structure is divided into lobes, each serving distinct functions, from vision (occipital) to decision-making (frontal). Brain imaging techniques like MRI and PET scans allow scientists to study the brain’s structure and function. These technologies, alongside brain stimulation methods, offer insights into how specific brain regions contribute to different mental processes. When damaged, brain areas can lead to conditions like aphasia, affecting language comprehension and speech.
