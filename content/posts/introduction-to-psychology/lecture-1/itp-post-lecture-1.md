#### Lecture summary:

Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. It systematically examines how the brain operates, its structure, and how it influences observable actions. To understand behavior, psychologists analyze three levels: the brain, the individual, and group dynamics. Psychological inquiry often contrasts scientific methods with intuition. Science relies on empirical data and systematic experimentation, while intuition involves more automatic and emotional thinking. Psychologists prefer empirical methods to ensure objectivity and accuracy.

Psychology has evolved, influenced by various perspectives. Structuralism focused on understanding consciousness through introspection, while functionalism examined how mental processes help individuals adapt to their environment. The psychodynamic perspective, introduced by Freud, emphasized the unconscious and early childhood experiences. Behaviorism shifted the focus to observable behavior, arguing that internal mental states are less important. Humanistic psychology, on the other hand, highlighted free will, personal growth, and self-actualization. Modern psychology also embraces biological, cognitive, evolutionary, and social-cultural perspectives. Each offers insights into different aspects of human behavior, from brain functions to cultural influences. Finally, the discipline employs various research methods—descriptive, correlational, experimental—to explore complex psychological phenomena, always ensuring ethical standards are upheld in research.
