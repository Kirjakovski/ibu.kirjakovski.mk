#### Lecture summary:

Cognitive psychology rose to prominence in the 1960s, largely influenced by the computer model, which likened the human mind to a system for data input, processing, storage, and retrieval. Key concepts include memory, the ability to store and recall information, and cognition, which is the process of acquiring and utilizing knowledge. Memory plays a vital role in daily life, from simple tasks like recalling names to complex skills like programming. However, memory is not a flawless record of past experiences. Instead, it is reconstructive, piecing information together through perceptions, emotions, and beliefs, which can introduce errors.

Memory processes consist of encoding (storing experiences), storage (retaining information), and retrieval (accessing stored data). Encoding failure often leads to forgetting. Only significant details are usually encoded, while unimportant information is disregarded. Elaborative encoding, which links new data with known concepts or visual cues, improves retention. Memory is structured in stages, starting with sensory memory, which briefly holds large amounts of sensory information. Short-term memory (STM) then temporarily stores small amounts of data, typically in chunks, for a few seconds, whereas working memory (WM) involves more complex processing, using both auditory and visuospatial systems managed by a central executive.

Long-term memory (LTM) can store vast amounts of information for extended periods. It includes explicit memories, which are consciously accessible (like facts and events), and implicit memories, which influence behavior unconsciously (like procedural skills). Explicit memories further divide into semantic (general knowledge) and episodic (personal experiences). Implicit memory supports learned skills, priming, and conditioned responses.
