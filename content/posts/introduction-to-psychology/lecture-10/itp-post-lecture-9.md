#### Lecture summary:

Psychological disorders encompass abnormal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that cause distress or disrupt daily functioning. Diagnosed primarily through clinical observations and the DSM, these disorders lack definitive biological markers. Abnormality is assessed based on deviance from societal norms, dysfunction impairing life activities, distress, or risk of harm.

The biopsychosocial model highlights the interplay of biological (genetics, brain function), psychological (negative thought patterns, stress), and social (socioeconomic factors, discrimination) contributors. Disorders are classified into categories such as anxiety (e.g., OCD, PTSD), mood (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), personality (e.g., borderline, antisocial), and conditions like schizophrenia, characterized by psychosis. Developmental disorders like ADHD and autism emerge in childhood, influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

Stigma around mental illness persists, leading to discrimination and reluctance to seek help. Cultural norms also shape perceptions, with not all atypical behaviors deemed pathological. Overcoming stigma and understanding these conditions in context are critical for effective support and recovery.
