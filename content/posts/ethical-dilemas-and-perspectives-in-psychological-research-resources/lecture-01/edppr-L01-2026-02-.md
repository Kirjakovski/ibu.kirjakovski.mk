## Lecture Summary:

Ethical practice in psychological research did not emerge fully formed. It evolved through tension, crisis, and critical reflection. The contemporary landscape reflects a long-standing friction between regulatory systems shaped by biomedicine and the lived realities of social science research.

At the heart of this tension lies a mismatch. Biomedical ethics developed around a model focused on preventing physical harm, emphasizing protection and procedural control. Social science research, by contrast, often unfolds in fluid, relational, and context-sensitive environments. The resulting frustration—sometimes described as “ethics creep”—stems not from disagreement about whether ethics matter, but from disagreement about how ethics should be enacted in practice. Both regulators and researchers share the same premise: research must be morally justified. The challenge is moving from mere compliance toward intelligent, context-aware ethical conduct.

Historically, modern regulation was catalyzed by atrocities and scandals. The Nuremberg Code established voluntary consent as non-negotiable, and the Declaration of Helsinki institutionalized independent review. In the United States, the Belmont Report formalized three core principles—respect for persons, beneficence, and justice—translating moral theory into regulatory doctrine. Meanwhile, controversial social science studies—Milgram’s obedience experiments, Humphreys’ Tearoom Trade, and Zimbardo’s prison study—reinforced demands for oversight.

Philosophically, ethical reasoning draws from multiple traditions. Consequentialism evaluates actions by outcomes, seeking the greatest good, yet risks justifying harmful means. Deontology grounds morality in duties and universal principles, even when consequences are unfavorable. Virtue ethics shifts attention to the character of the researcher, emphasizing courage, humility, and integrity. Principlism attempts a middle path through autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice—but can devolve into a checklist approach.

Contemporary critiques push further. Feminist and relational ethics emphasize care and context. Situated ethics rejects universal rules in favor of in-field judgment. Post-colonial perspectives question power, imperialism, and who benefits from research. Emerging digital contexts—big data, video ethnography, human–computer interaction—complicate consent and privacy assumptions. The trajectory is clear: ethical practice cannot be reduced to rules alone. It requires reflexivity—the cultivated capacity to interpret principles, navigate context, and act with integrity.
