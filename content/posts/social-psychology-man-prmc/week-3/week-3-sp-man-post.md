#### Lecture summary:

The lecture explored the concept of self, focusing on self-concept, self-awareness, and self-perception. Self-concept is defined as the beliefs individuals hold about their personal attributes, with self-schema acting as a cognitive framework guiding perception and evaluation. The development of self-concept begins in early childhood, with human self-recognition emerging between 18-24 months. Cultural influences shape self-concept, with independent and interdependent views of self highlighting differences in self-definition based on personal attributes versus relationships.

Introspection and self-perception theory were discussed as methods of self-understanding, noting that people often infer their attitudes by observing their behavior, especially when feelings are ambiguous. Self-awareness theory suggests that focusing on oneself can lead to behavior evaluation against internal standards, though this can be uncomfortable. Introspection has limits, as many mental processes occur outside awareness, leading to reliance on causal theories influenced by culture.

The lecture also covered motivation, distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and the overjustification effect, where external rewards can undermine intrinsic interest. The two-factor theory of emotion was introduced, explaining how physiological arousal and situational context contribute to emotional experience. Misattribution of arousal was illustrated through studies showing how people can misinterpret the causes of their emotions.

Social comparison theory was discussed, emphasizing how individuals learn about themselves by comparing to others, with upward and downward comparisons serving different goals. Social tuning and affective forecasts were mentioned as ways people adopt others' views and predict emotional responses.

Self-control and impression management were addressed, highlighting strategies for maintaining self-control and managing how others perceive us. Finally, self-esteem was examined, including its role in terror management theory and the rise of narcissism.
