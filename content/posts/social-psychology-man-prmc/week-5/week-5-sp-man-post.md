## Lecture summary:

The lecture on attitudes in social psychology explored the origins, components, and influences on attitudes. Attitudes are evaluations of people, objects, and ideas, shaped by genetics and social experiences. They consist of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Cognitively based attitudes rely on beliefs about an object, while affectively based attitudes stem from feelings and values, often influenced by conditioning. Behaviorally based attitudes are derived from observing one's behavior toward an object, as explained by self-perception theory.

Explicit attitudes are conscious and reportable, whereas implicit attitudes are unconscious and rooted in childhood experiences. Attitudes predict behavior under specific conditions, influenced by attitude accessibility and the theory of planned behavior, which considers specific attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.

Attitudes can change due to social influence and persuasive communication. The Yale Attitude Change Approach examines factors affecting attitude change, focusing on the source, message, and audience. The Elaboration Likelihood Model describes central and peripheral routes to persuasion, with personal relevance and ability to pay attention influencing which route is taken. Fear-arousing communications can be effective if they enable attention to arguments.

Emotionally and cognitively based attitudes respond best to corresponding appeals. Physical environment and body posture can affect attitude change. Strategies for resisting persuasion include attitude inoculation, awareness of product placement, and reactance theory, which suggests that perceived threats to freedom can lead to resistance.
