## Lecture summary:

The lecture on conformity and obedience in social psychology outlined various forms of social influence: persuasion, compliance, conformity, and obedience. Persuasion involves actively changing attitudes through communication, while compliance refers to behavior change triggered by requests, without necessarily altering beliefs. Conformity is an adjustment of behavior or attitudes to align with group norms, often driven by the desire for social acceptance, whereas obedience involves following direct commands from authority figures, focusing mainly on external behavior.

Informational social influence occurs when individuals rely on others’ interpretations in ambiguous situations, leading to genuine belief changes, as demonstrated in Sherif’s autokinetic experiments. The importance of accuracy can increase conformity, especially when individuals value correct responses highly, as shown by Baron et al. Conversely, normative social influence is driven by social acceptance, leading mainly to public compliance without private belief change. Asch’s line-judgment studies revealed that conformity rises with group size up to a point and is stronger in collectivist cultures or when one has no allies.

Minority influence challenges conformity by introducing change through consistency over time, relying on informational influence. Social norms are divided into injunctive norms (perceptions of what behaviors are approved) and descriptive norms (perceptions of actual behaviors), both affecting behavior like littering, though descriptive norms alone can sometimes cause a boomerang effect.

Additional influence tactics include foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face techniques, as well as propaganda. Obedience, the most powerful social influence, explains how ordinary individuals commit atrocities under authoritative commands. Milgram’s experiments demonstrated high obedience rates but revealed context and situational factors that modulate this behavior, such as proximity to the authority or victim and the presence of dissenters. Obedience is maintained by conforming to shifting norms, self-justification, and loss of personal responsibility, rather than aggression or evil intentions.
